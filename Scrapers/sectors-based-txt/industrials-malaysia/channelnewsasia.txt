Malaysia's Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said the plan would require an estimated total investment of RM95 billion, predominantly from the private sector.
"This creation of high-value job opportunities is crucial to uplift and expand the middle-class society," Anwar said at the launch of the masterplan.
The plan aims to increase the manufacturing sector's value by 6.5 per cent in seven years and projects employment growth in the sector at 2.3 per cent from 2023, Anwar said.
