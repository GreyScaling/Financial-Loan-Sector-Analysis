        BRC Asia posts 2% fall in H2 net profit to S$49.5 million 
","STEEL solutions provider BRC Asia posted a 2 per cent fall in net profit to S$49.5 million for its second half ended Sep 30, 2023, from S$50.4 million in the same period a year earlier.
 The company saw a weaker performance in FY2023 compared with record results in FY2022. But it had been on a steady recovery path over the last six months, with gradually normalising activity levels of local construction projects, BRC Asia said on Tuesday (Nov 21). Earnings per share stood at 18.05 Singapore cents for the half-year period, down from 18.36 cents the previous year.
 Revenue for H2 was largely flat at S$909.9 million, from S$905.9 million a year earlier.
 For the full year ended Sep 30, 2023, net profit fell 16 per cent to S$75.7 million while revenue fell 4 per cent to S$1.6 billion.
 In FY2023, the company navigated a temporary slowdown in the local construction industry resulting from project safety timeouts, and also incurred losses and impairment of S$7.8 million in an investment in a Maldives resort, it said.

 On the back of improving industry prospects and solid company fundamentals, the company is proposing a final dividend of 5.5 cents per share, and a special dividend of 5.5 cents per share, for the half-year period.
 In comparison, BRC Asia declared a final dividend and special dividend of six cents per share each in the same period last year.  The dividends proposed in H2 FY2023 bring the total dividend for FY2023 to 16 cents per share, representing a payout ratio of 58 per cent. The books closure date and payment date will be announced later. Commenting on the company’s performance, BRC Asia chief executive Seah Kiin Peng noted that it still managed to secure the second-highest full-year net profit in its history on the back of a strong second half.
 Looking ahead, the company expects that the local construction sector will continue to recover.  It also expects to be well-positioned to fulfil its strong order book and seize additional growth opportunities in the foreseeable future.  Shares of BRC Asia closed flat at S$1.65 on Tuesday, before the results were released.

        Sluggish loan growth, economic uncertainties cloud Singapore’s banking prospects: RHB
","RHB Research has cut its weighting for the banking sector to “neutral” from “overweight” as it foresees waning business and consumer sentiment, along with low demand for credit, to partially offset still-healthy net interest margins (NIMs) of Singapore’s banks. These factors are likely to keep the share prices of the banks range-bound in the near future, said RHB’s research team in a report on Monday (Jul 10). UOB is RHB’s top sector pick as the only banking stock with a “buy” recommendation, given its smallest exposure to China among the trio of local banks. The research house is “neutral” on DBS and recently downgraded OCBC to the same.  Noting that sector loans “remained subdued” in Q2 2023, along with stagnation in Singapore’s manufacturing and financial services sectors, RHB said there may be downside risks to its sector loans’ growth forecast of 3.7 per cent on the year.  “Given investor concerns that these two sectors would continue to languish in the near term, business sentiment has turned weak, with demand for credit noticeably softer and NIM tailwinds waning,” added the research team.  It believes investors are likely to “shy away from bank stocks” in the immediate term given the weaker external outlook.

A drop in new housing loan bookings due to recent property cooling measures is only likely to impact banks’ mortgage books a year later, it said.  RHB also anticipates credit demand and investment banking activities to remain soft in H2 2023, as it believes business confidence and consumer sentiment has weakened due to heightened growth uncertainties in global economies.  Unfavourable market conditions have further hindered Singapore banks’ ability to deploy funds from strong inflows of net new money, it noted.
 Despite overall expectations of sluggish loan growth, NIMs remain a bright spot for the banking sector as RHB forecasts another year of strong net interest income (NII).  The research team projects the banks’ NIMs to average at higher levels in FY2023 than FY2022, as much of the 500 basis points increase in US interest rates already occurred in H2 2022. Overall sector earnings are predicted to grow by 23 per cent year on year in FY2023 due to healthy NII growth and a moderation in operating expenditure growth.
 This will, however, be followed by a “muted” 1 per cent year-on-year growth in FY2024, said RHB, as NIMs are expected to narrow due to higher cost of funds.  Although sector valuations appear “undemanding” in its view, RHB noted that the banks’ share prices have underperformed the broader market’s year-to-date decline.  “China’s slower-than-expected economic recovery and troubled property sector are other headwinds that worry investors, even though the banks remain comfortable with their China exposures,” noted the analysts.

        Singapore fintech funding dives 41% to 3-year low, but expected to start recovering next year
","SINGAPORE fintech funding sank to a three-year low in the first half of 2023 as rising interest rates and economic headwinds continued to dent investor sentiment, but experts believe a recovery is on the horizon. Total deal value fell by 41 per cent to US$934 million across 84 deals in mergers and acquisitions, private equity and venture capital, from US$1.6 billion across 117 deals in H2 2022, KPMG said in its July 2023 Pulse of Fintech report. The H1 2023 tally marks a three-year low for Singapore, and fintech funding “has yet to fully correct from the pandemic funding surge that began in H2 2019”, the advisory firm said. Funding is still well above the US$344 million across 70 deals recorded in H1 2019.  Experts whom The Business Times spoke to believe that fintech deal volume and funding will start recovering from 2024. “Singapore fintech funding values are primarily driven by large deals, and we don’t see (any) large deals happening this year,” said Shauraya Bhutani, co-founder of Singapore-based boutique investment bank Capital Connect Advisors. He noted that bigger fintechs will prefer to wait it out as valuations are still relatively depressed, and most of the Series B+ transactions in the space are led by international investors who have pulled back and are unlikely to come in this year.

 Global market challenges are expected to ease in the months ahead as interest rate growth slows down and inflation comes under control, said Sunil Rai, senior partner at Dentons Rodyk and co-head of its venture tech and emerging growth companies practice group. He expects fintech deal volume to rise as investors become more confident in allocating capital towards early-stage investments.  He said: “We know of several fintech-focused institutional investors with ready funds to invest and (are) looking for the appropriate opportunities to do so. There is also an increase in family offices in Singapore (which) are looking to allocate some capital towards early-stage investments, including fintech.” However, deals are taking longer to close, as investors conduct more extensive due diligence than before, he added. Roshan Raj Behera, partner at Redseer Strategy Consultants, said fintech investment activity will improve gradually from 2024, underpinned by better unit economics, reasonable private market valuations, record levels of unused private capital, and potential initial public offerings.  While funding may not climb back to pandemic highs, it is unlikely to stagnate either, he said. This is because most South-east Asian economies have better macroeconomic prospects than their developed market counterparts, and also offer structural growth opportunities in various new-economy sectors. Global Fintech Institute co-founder Chia Hock Lai said that the fintech sector is “still undergoing a funding winter and is unlikely to see any recovery until 2024”.
 “We are unlikely to see the past highs as interest rates are expected to moderate downwards but not as low as previously – the days of ultra-cheap funding are over,” he added. Investors are turning their attention to artificial intelligence (AI) and sustainability-related fintechs, and Chia believes these sectors will do well in the near future.
 Payments and cryptocurrency continued to be among the top areas for fintech funding in Singapore, said KPMG. In payments, consolidation proved essential in driving funding activity despite economic headwinds and higher market volatility, as fintechs grew their reach through acquisitions, it said.  It added that the AI and machine-learning space was also well-funded, closing six deals worth US$129 million in H1 2023 from none before. Anton Ruddenklau, global fintech leader at KPMG, said: “It is still very early days when it comes to the application of generative AI to use cases in financial services. But looking forward, it is an area that is attracting enormous interest and funding, particularly in areas like cybersecurity, (regulatory tech), and wealthtech.” Globally, total funding and deal tally fell to US$52.4 billion across 2,153 deals in H1 2023, from US$63.2 billion over 2,885 deals in H2 2022. Supply chain and logistics, as well as the green sector, were among the top areas for funding, KPMG found. There is a “cloud of uncertainty” in the global market that continues to affect investor confidence, driven by factors such as high inflation and increasing interest rates, geopolitical tensions and headwinds in the technology sector, the firm said. It noted that the collapse of some US banks earlier this year may have kept investors in a “wait-and-see” mode in H1 2023. In the Asia-Pacific, fintech funding similarly fell to US$5.1 billion across 432 deals in H1 2023, from US$6.8 billion across 583 deals in H2 2022. Two fintech deals by Singapore-based entities – credit services firm Kredivo Holdings and consumer finance company Trusting Social – were among the top 10 deals in the region in the period, raising US$270 million and US$105 million, respectively.   “The current funding winter is leading to more industry consolidation and focus on (the) path to profitability. However, the long-term prospects of fintech continue to be bright, both from innovative fintech solutions fulfilling gaps in emerging markets and financial institutions undergoing digital transformation to remain competitive,” said Global Fintech Institute’s Chia. Judd Caplain, global head of financial services at KPMG, said: “The long-term business case for many sub-sectors within fintech remains very strong, particularly for sectors like payments, (insurance tech), and wealthtech. Once market conditions begin to even out, funding will likely rebound – if not to the record level experienced in 2021.” ",businesstimes,Financials,Singapore
