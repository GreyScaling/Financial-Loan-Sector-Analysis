            Construction sector to remain below pre-pandemic levels amidst labour shortage 
        ","
The government’s worker retention scheme partially reduced project delays and labour costs.
Despite the construction industry’s growth nearing 2019 levels, professional services firm, Turner & Townsend, projects that the sector’s performance will remain below pre-pandemic levels in the large part of 2022 amidst labour shortage.
Turner & Townsend said the Singapore government’s worker retention scheme between September 2021 and February 2022 mitigated only partially alleviated the project delays and soaring labour costs. 
The firm also cited that replenishing migrant labour workers on-site amidst easing of border controls will require time 
Restoring migrant labour on-site further to the easing of border controls will require time and careful process to ensure public safety, whilst the costs of hiring new migrant workers to meet COVID-19 safety precautions remain high, the firm added.
Aside from labour woes, the local industry’s dependence on imports was dragged down, following a sharp increase in oil prices and global supply chain challenges will continue to increase the price of construction materials and costs of transport and machinery operations.
To support more off-site work along with higher-skilled work permit holders, the Government has allocated funds to boost the industry’s digital capabilities and talent attraction. 
As this happens, the government will also lower the migrant worker dependency ratio ceiling and replace its current man-year entitlement (MYE) framework with a levy framework to reduce dependence on migrant labour.
These challenges would need sustained efforts in the industry to address these risks in a more equitable manner between stakeholders. Over the long term, these approaches will help the resilience of Singapore’s construction sector to withstand market volatility.
In the fourth quarter of 2021, on a yearly basis, the sector saw a 2.9% growth in the fourth quarter of 2021. Citing Building and Construction Authority’s (BCA) projections, overall construction demand may reach between $27b and $32b for 2022 after a 42% increase in 2021 totaling $29.9b.

            Hong Leong Asia’s earnings to grow 52% this year 
        ","
The building materials segment sets the foundation for the firm’s recovery.
Hong Leong Asia (HLA) is expected to see a 52% earnings growth in 2021 on the back of its building materials and diesel engine segments.
“HLA’s building materials unit is one of the largest integrated players in Singapore, providing ready-mix concrete and precast concrete elements for public housing construction,” UOB Kay Hian said, adding that it has the fourth largest Malaysian cement producer, Tasek, as its subsidiary.
The brokerage firm expects earnings in the building materials segment to shoot by 55% for 2021, driven by better sales volume and higher prices of precast and ready-mix concrete as construction activities resume.
Growth in HLA’s diesel engine segment, UOB Kay Hian noted, will be driven by China Yuchai International, a 44.7% owned subsidiary of the company. It manufactures and sells engines for trucks, passenger vehicles, industrial equipment, and agricultural equipment.
“Despite major disruptions due to COVID-19, China Yuchai recorded a 14.4% year-on-year (YoY) increase in the number of engine units, as a result of the growth in China’s agriculture segment. We expect the earnings of China Yuchai to grow by 17% YoY for 2021, as the growth momentum should continue in 2021 from greater buying activity in National VI(a) compliant diesel engines before its full implementation on 1 July 2021,” UOB Kay Hian said.
New energy solutions could also drive long-term growth for the company, following the partnership China Yuchai’s forged with Guangxi Shenlong Automobile Manufacturing to develop electronic vehicles on 2 June 2021.
On the back of these developments, HLA has disposed of its loss-making air-conditioning business in the first half of 2021.

            Singapore’s technical consumer goods market grows 2.4% in 2022 
        ","
BNPL schemes pushed consumers to buy goods amidst rising prices.
Despite rising inflation, Singapore’s technical consumer goods (TGC) market bounced back to growth in 2022, with volume rising by 2.4%.
Data from GfK showed that sales also increased across types of TCG like small domestic appliances (SDA) and the photo sector, recording 11% and 33.1% growth, respectively. 
Telecom sales, however, declined  2%, whilst office equipment and IT products reeled from a sales drop of 6%.
“Office equipment and IT goods underwent slower growth after demand for home workspaces in the post-pandemic age had been fulfilled and employees returning to the office. The demand for telecom products had also softened with possible longer replacement cycles and as unit production waned, however, foldable mobile phones have created a niche in the premium segment reporting value growth,” GfK said. 
Meanwhile, GfK observed that consumers were still willing to buy TCG, despite elevated prices due to buy now, pay later and zero per cent interest instalment schemes.
The payment schemes helped boost sales of washing machines, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners and panel television by 62%, 48%, 33% and 29%, respectively.

            Why Tim Hortons bets on ‘third-place’ to be first in Singapore’s coffee market 
        ","
The brand aims to offer unique and healthier choices for consumers.
For Tim Hortons, dominating ‘third place’ in Singapore’s Western coffee market scene is its main strategy to compete against local coffee brands and grab-and-go models with cheaper options
“Third places,” as described by sociologist Ray Oldenburg, are locations that facilitate social interaction, usually a public place people frequent. This often refers to places where people spend time aside from their homes (first place) or work (second place). Coffee shops and cafes with relaxed atmospheres are often called third-place locations.
Tim Hortons Singapore CEO Vaibhav Punj said that capturing this market is better than competing directly with koptiams, new age cafes and coffee roasters, and a recent spike of grab-and-go coffee concepts who just entered the market.
“The size of the piece is quite big as well. We think we can build a very successful business in Singapore,” Punj said.
“Singapore is an interesting market. There are three very clear markets, the Central Business District (CBD), the heartland malls, and the tourist-specific malls like Sentosa and Orchard. We are looking at all these clusters and we intend to open 10 to 15 restaurants going forward,” Punj said.
He added that having a restaurant footprint is important for Tim Hortons because around 70% of their revenue comes from in-store sales, compared to takeaway and delivery which accounts for around 25%-30%.
“We will continue to look at locations, which are the right size for us. We are not planning to open really massive restaurants at this point in time, because I think that's something which is not viable anymore. People are not utilising all that space,” Punj said.
“We will continue to look at locations, which are the right size for us. We are not planning to open really massive restaurants at this point in time, because I think that’s something which is not viable anymore. People are not utilising all that space,” Punj said.
Tim Hortons has, so far, opened in VivoCity. They also plan to open branches in NEX, Suntec City, One Raffles Place, and Jurong Point.
Punj said Tim Hortons’ entry into Singapore will serve as a “stepping stone” for the brand to get into neighbouring countries like Indonesia and Malaysia which are also bigger markets.
""Given that [Singapore] is a regional hub, we are trying to create an HQ in Singapore to be able to manage the markets which are around Singapore,” he said.
Healthier products, unique offerings
Singapore, where diabetes is a serious health concern and interest in healthy diets is growing, Tim Hortons is strategically positioning itself to stand out in the crowded coffee market by tweaking its menu items to ensure it fits Singapore's Nutri-Grade guidelines. 
The Ministry of Health (MOH) announced that beginning 30 December 2023, freshly prepared beverages must be graded based on their sugar and saturated fat content.
 
“The whole idea is to give options to people to choose whether they want something less sweet, or more sweet,” Punj said.
 
Tim Hortons had also made an effort to cater to Singaporean consumers by lowering the sweetness levels of their products.
 
“In general, the sweetness levels [of our products in Singapore] are lower than some of what our other Asian markets and even Western markets can take,” Punj said.
 
Tim Hortons’ commitment to cater to health-conscious Singaporeans extends beyond just reducing sugar levels or offering nutri-grade products.
 
The Canadian coffeehouse and restaurant chain is also working with its suppliers to create products that have ingredients that are free of artificial flavours and preservatives.
 
“[We want to have] more clean label products coming into the restaurants. It’s a hard thing to do, but this is something which we are working with our suppliers extremely closely,” Punj told the publication.
 
Recognising Singapore’s strong dedication to environmental sustainability, Tim Hortons is broadening its focus beyond just offering healthier options. Punj said Tim Hortons uses sustainable packaging materials and even uses sustainable palm oil in their kitchen.
 
“In every single aspect of the restaurant, there is a sustainability piece to that,” Punj said.

            Tech spending in Singapore to jump 4.6% in 2023 to $22.17b  
        ","
Software will be the highest growth area in terms of spend.
Singaporean government and business spending on tech goods and services will likely increase by 4.6% in 2023 to $22.17b, data from Forrester showed.
In a report, Forrester said software will be the highest growth area in 2023, with an expected spend of $7.0b.
Communications equipment ($5.1b vs $5.0b) ), tech outsourcing and hardware maintenance ($3.6b vs $3.3b), and tech consulting and systems integration services ($3.3b vs $3.1b) will also see a spending increase in 2023. 
Forrester said it expects tech spending growth in Singapore on the back of its 2022 measures such as the Productivity Solutions Grant, the Enterprise Development Grant, and the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit. 
In 2023, Singapore also implemented a $4b top-up to the National Productivity Fund and tax deductions for businesses that conduct R&D through the new Enterprise Innovation Scheme.
Whilst the “Silicon Valley of Asia” remains as a  global leader in digital and AI readiness, Forrester said Singapore must invest in developing local digital skills and improve the cost base for companies and tech talent.
“Singapore has faced an almost unprecedented rise in living costs, driven by a surging rental market. It’s already the most expensive city in the world; seven in 10 businesses say they are ready to relocate personnel elsewhere if costs do not stabilize,” the report stated.
“Rising costs have also affected the return of talent; the expatriate workforce only came close to regaining pre-pandemic numbers in December 2022. This is significant because up to two-thirds of tech sector professionals are from abroad,” it added.
