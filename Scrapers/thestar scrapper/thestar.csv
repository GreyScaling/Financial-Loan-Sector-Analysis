                 PETALING JAYA: Malaysia’s consumer sector could face a more challenging year ahead in 2023. That is according to RHB Research, who said the sector’s related stocks face headwinds in the form of a potential global economic slowdown, the absence of consumer spending boosters and a potential prolonged inflationary environment. In addition, the high earnings base of 2022 would also exert pressure on the sector’s bottomline growth next year. In view of the challenges, RHB Research advised investors to focus on companies with stronger pricing power to withstand a prolonged or further escalation in inflationary pressure. “We also recommend investors consider players with sustainable growth prospects beyond the post-pandemic earnings normalisation and pent-up demand,” it said in a note yesterday. The research house has maintained its “neutral” view on the consumer sector. RHB Research expects the consumer sector’s encouraging earnings growth momentum to be sustained across the second half of 2022. “The feedback gathered from the consumer companies we engaged with points to robust third quarter of 2022 (3Q22) numbers, notwithstanding the weaker seasonality of the lack of a festive season during that period. “As such, we expect 3Q22 earnings to soften versus the exceptionally strong 2Q22, but numbers should still indicate a solid recovery on a year-on-year (y-o-y) and versus pre-pandemic basis. “Thereafter, 4Q22 should also bring robust numbers, taking into account the year-end holidays and festivities,” RHB Research added. Commenting on the 2Q22 results, RHB Research described the performance as “above expectations” and marked the “second beat in a row”. Of the 14 companies under its coverage, eight surprised on the upside, three were within expectations and three disappointed. According to RHB Research, the three companies that underperformed were MR DIY Group (M) Bhd, Farm Fresh Bhd and NTPM Holdings Bhd. “Considering the footfall normalisation post 1Q22 slowdown (due to the spread of the Omicron variant), the first Aidil Fitri celebration in three years and the spending boost from Employees Provident Fund withdrawals, 2Q22 was widely anticipated to be strong, but the actual results managed to outperform these positive expectations. “Among all, consumer discretionary or retail companies and brewers clocked the most outstanding results, as they reaped the benefits of the recovery in consumption,” RHB Research said. In 2Q22, the consumer sector’s revenue surged by 33% y-o-y and 9% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q). All companies under RHB Research’s coverage reported robust revenue growth year-on-year, from the much-improved market conditions following the broader reopening of the economy. “The q-o-q growth was strong across the board, as footfall recovered post the 1Q22 slowdown (when the country was affected by the Omicron wave). “Margins were also encouraging, driven by the sales volume recovery and the implementation of price increases,” it said. RHB Research’s top picks for the consumer sector are Power Root Bhd, Berjaya Food Bhd, Texchem Resources Bhd, MR DIY and Heineken Malaysia Bhd.

1,Earnings of consumer product companies to be affected by inflation,"
                    Monday, 13 Nov 2023
                 PETALING JAYA: Consumer product companies’ earnings for the third quarter of 2023 (3Q23) are likely to reflect cautious sentiment amid inflationary pressures which have eroded the disposable incomes of the people, says RHB Research. This, together with the inflationary risks arising from reform measures such as subsidy rationalisation, may have been largely priced into the valuations. However, a stable employment market and continued government financial aid to the lower-income groups should support consumer spending, said RHB Research in its latest report. The research house, which is “neutral” on the sector, said “the subdued consumer sentiment and cautious spending should persist in 3Q23 – a relatively quiet quarter seasonally with the absence of major festivals and lengthy holidays.” Hence, the top line growth should be unexciting, from the high 3Q22 base boosted by the post-pandemic economy reopening. “Meanwhile, we believe the rising operating costs will continue to eat into margins. “The risk of earnings disappointments could be more prevalent in the consumer discretionary sub-segment as consumers may have reduced non-essential spending,” it added. On the flipside, Leong Hup International Bhd could surprise on the upside, considering the sustainable turnaround in Indonesia and the easing of feed costs, said RHB Research, which has a target price of 72 sen on the stock. On the consumer boycotts arising from geopolitical tensions, the brokerage firm said this would likely have a negative impact on Nestle (M) Bhd and Starbucks under Berjaya Food Bhd.
