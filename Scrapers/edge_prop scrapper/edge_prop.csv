The annual survey by consulting firm Turner & Townsend charts the average construction cost per sqm for commercial, residential and industrial projects in 89 markets worldwide.In Asia, strong demand in established real estate markets like Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, and South Korea faces skills shortages and rising labour costs, leading to increased construction expenses.Tokyo and Osaka are Asia's priciest cities for construction, with Tokyo at US$4,567 ($6,167) per sq m and Osaka at US$4,497 per sq m. Globally, Tokyo ranks fifth, and Osaka ranks sixth in construction cost.AdvertisementThe average construction cost per sqm for Hong Kong clocked in at $4,292, placing it in 11th position among the top ten markets globally. Meanwhile, Singapore's construction cost averages US$3,307 per sqm, ranking it fourth in Asia and 31st globally.Turner & Townsend highlights that Singapore saw the highest rate of construction cost escalation last year at 12%. As the market continues to face skills capacity challenges and high labour and material costs, the firm is anticipating construction costs to remain high, with a growth rate of 8% projected for 2023.Singapore remains supported by a strong pipeline of construction projects driven by public housing, infrastructure, commercial developments, and an emerging biomedical sector. Elsewhere, Japan’s construction activity is bolstered by a strong backlog of construction projects in the lead-up to the World Expo that will be held in Osaka in 2025, while Hong Kong and Mainland China are expected to see a recovery in their construction sectors following the lifting of prolonged Covid-19 restrictions.The survey also notes that construction activity in emerging markets such as India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines is warming up amid significant investments in real estate and growing expansion of data centres, manufacturing and life sciences.“Asia’s diverse and ambitious market economies place it in a strong position to command sustained construction growth and attract investment, particularly in industrial, science and technology, healthcare, transport and real estate developments,” says Cheryl Lum, director and head of data and research at Turner & Townsend Asia.https://www.edgeprop.sg/property-news/singapore-average-construction-cost-fourth-highest-asia-turner-and-townsendTags: construction costsSingaporeTurner & TownsendFollow UsFollow our channels to receive property news updates 24/7 round the clock.EdgeProp TelegramEdgeProp FacebookSubscribe to our newsletterSubscribeAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementTop Articles1Hillhaven and The Arcady record sales of over 50 units each on launch weekend2Chinese couple buys two adjacent units at The Ritz-Carlton Residences for record $5,397 psf3GuocoLand-led consortium sole bidder for Marina Gardens Crescent white site at $984 psf ppr4Would the Orchard Boulevard site be awarded after Marina Gardens Crescent’s rejected bid? 5Residential transactions with contracts dated Jan 2 to 9 [DONE DEALS]Search Articles",Edge-Prop,Construction
1,Contractors and developers to face skilled labour crunch and high costs in 2024,"Contractors and developers to face skilled labour crunch and high costs in 2024By Timothy Tay / EdgeProp Singapore | December 7, 2023 6:00 AM SGTThe Skywaters at 8 Shenton Way, which is now under construction, is set to be Singapore’s tallest skyscraper when it is completed in 2028. (Picture: Albert Chua/The Edge Singapore)Join our  Telegram  channel and follow our  Facebook  for the latest update.Singapore’s construction sector has enjoyed a year of reprieve as developers and builders finally put most of the supply-chain disruptions and backlog of projects behind them. This year, demand and output levels in the construction sector are expected to be on a par with its performance in 2022.Khoo Sze Boon, managing director for Singapore and Vietnam, Turner & Townsend, forecasts that construction demand for the entire 2023 will range from $27 billion to $32 billion, while overall output for the sector will range from $30 billion to $33 billion. Last year, construction demand amounted to $29.79 billion while output was $30.2 billion, according to statistics from the Building and Construction Authority.However, market sentiment among stakeholders in the built environment industry are still cautious amid the high interest rate environment that is pushing up costs. Meanwhile, labour shortages are not as acute compared to 2020/2021, but changes to the dependency ratio ceiling (DRC) from January next year could impact productivity, says Aaron Foong, managing director of KTP Consultants, a member of Surbana Jurong Group.Read also: Koh Brothers Eco secures $186 mil contract from HDBAdvertisementHeadline projects in 2024The local construction sector is on track to be one of the top contributors to Singapore’s economic growth this year, says Scott Halyday, director of Linesight Singapore. “For 2023, the construction sector is forecast to grow by 6.3% as both public- and private-sector construction output rose,” he says.Much of the growth in construction output this year was buoyed by an improvement in tourism activity, the growth in wholesale and retail trade construction demand, as well as new data centre projects, says Halyday.Halyday: For 2023, the construction sector is forecast to grow by 6.3% as both public- and private-sector construction output rose. (Picture: Linesight)Notable private-sector projects that have contributed to the positive construction output this year include the redevelopment of 8 Shenton Way (former AXA Towers) into The Skywaters mixed-use development, as well as en bloc projects like Ming Arcade at 21 Cuscaden Road, and the redevelopment of Tanglin Shopping Centre at 19 Tanglin Road, says Foong.“In the public sector, there are several ongoing projects such as the second phase of the Cross Island MRT Line as well as future projects like the 12ha Toa Payoh Integrated Development and the redevelopment and extension of Woodlands Checkpoint,” says Foong.In October, the Land Transport Authority awarded the construction contracts of two interchange stations under the Cross Island Line. The $447 million contract for the design and construction of King Albert Park Station was awarded to China Communications Construction Co (CCCC), while the $514 million design and construction contract for Clementi Station was awarded to a joint venture between CCCC and Sinohydro Corp.Construction demand will get a further shot in the arm next year when work begins on the extensions to the two integrated resorts — Resorts World Sentosa and Marina Bay Sands. According to Khoo, work packages relating to both two projects will be tendered and awarded next year.Read also: What’s in store for Singapore’s construction sector and commodity pricesAdvertisementMarina Bay Sands is planning a fourth tower which will feature 1,000 hotel rooms, a 15,000-seater entertainment arena, exhibition halls, luxury retail, and a new sky roof with a swimming pool. Construction work on the $4.5 billion expansion is expected to start by April next year. Meanwhile, Resorts World Sentosa says it will complete expansions to Universal Studios Singapore and the SEA Aquarium next year.Khoo says some of the advance construction tenders and work packages for the future Changi East/Terminal 5 may also be issued and awarded next year. Construction of the new air freight and three-runway system is expected to start in 2025.Greater caution in project financingThe higher interest rate environment this year has also seen the cost of financing projects increase this year, says Khoo. “For many developers, we anticipate greater caution in project phasing, particularly for larger-scale projects,” he says, adding that contractors are likely to favour well-balanced payment terms.“This will have an overall positive impact on risk management. When payment terms are more balanced, it typically results in less risk pricing by contractors. This translates into more-competitive tender prices as a result,” says Khoo.According to the 3Q2023 Construction Tender Price Index (CTPI) published by the Singapore Institute of Surveyors and Valuers last month, the general tender price index rose slightly to 136.0 last quarter, from 135.8 in 1Q2023. Overall, tender prices remain high compared to 2019 when the index was at 99.9. The CTPI reflects the tender prices received for building projects in Singapore.“I don’t think we will see labour and material costs fully revert to pre-pandemic levels because the industry has evolved in the way it works and operates over the past few years. In addition, it is a function of demand and supply that heavily influences tender pricing and the price of labour and materials,” says Foong.Read also: BCA launches new banding system for construction quality assessment AdvertisementHe adds that the expected pipeline of construction contracts and tenders next year will drive up demand for labour and materials in Singapore, and he expects prices to respond accordingly.Halyday says that 2023 saw continued pressure on the supply chain due to global geopolitical volatility coupled with lingering effects of the pandemic. This resulted in elevated costs of raw materials and commodities, as well as longer lead times. “While 4Q2023 might see a calming of these commodity cost impacts, which bodes well for stability in 2024, the ongoing tensions and instability on the global geopolitical front are a cause for concern,” he says.Linesight is projecting that oil and diesel prices could increase further in the coming quarters, while lumber prices are also expected to stay relatively high into next year. Cement and concrete prices are expected to remain around current elevated levels in the coming quarters.However, steel prices are expected to continue to decline in the final quarter of this year, with weaker manufacturing output in the US and Europe, and the continued decline of activity in China’s residential sector to keep demand weak.Labour concerns endure“The shortage of labour doesn’t seem to have materialised as a major issue this year… but we will be watching the situation cautiously when the revised DRC is enforced next year,” says Foong.The DRC is the maximum ratio of foreign employees to the total workforce that a company in a given sector can employ. From Jan 1 next year, the DRC for the construction sector will be reduced from 1:7 (or about 87.5%) to 1:5 (or about 83.3%).In addition, the Man-Year Entitlement (MYE) framework will be dismantled from Jan 1, 2024. The MYE is a work permit allocation system for workers from China and non-traditional source (NTS) countries, such as India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and the Philippines. The MYE quota allocated to each project depends on the project type and the contract value, and firms that hire from NTS countries and China above their allocated MYE quotas will need to pay a higher levy rate.Foong: I don’t think we will see labour and material costs fully revert to pre-pandemic levels because the industry has evolved in the way it works and operates over the past few years. (Picture: KTP Consultants“In 2024, we will have to wait and see what impact these changes [in the DRC and MYE] will have on the local construction sector. In the case of the DRC, we should not underestimate the influence of a reduction in the ratio since our construction industry is still relatively labour-intensive,” says Foong.These sentiments were echoed by Halyday and Khoo who say that while overall labour pressures have eased, skilled labour shortages remain a significant constraint affecting the industry.“Although the job vacancy rate in the construction sector decreased to 2.3% in 2Q2023 from 4.0% in 2Q2022, it remains almost twice as high as pre-Covid-19 levels,” says Halyday.“We have observed that it is becoming more difficult to bring in specific talents, such as quantity surveyors and cost managers with job-specific competencies,” says Khoo, adding: “In addition, the shortage of dormitory spaces for migrant workers has become a challenge as it is now more difficult and costly to secure dormitory spaces.”Digitalisation turns mainstreamThe government’s push to transform the built environment sector, in particular efforts towards digitalisation and sustainability, has become mainstream throughout all levels of the built environment and construction sector in Singapore this year, says Foong.At a gathering of developers and built environment partners last month, Desmond Lee, Minister for National Development, cited the success of Corenet X in improving the system of regulatory submissions and approvals for development projects. “The system enables built environmental professionals to collaborate digitally on the same building model, allowing potential design conflicts and miscommunications to be resolved much earlier, saving time and cost,” says Lee.Foong says: “During this transition phase, there will be a fair bit of coordination between stakeholders. But I think if everyone is open-minded, the industry is taking steps in the right direction.”Geopolitical volatility and lingering effects of the pandemic have resulted in higher costs of raw materials and commodities this year. (Picture: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge Singapore)Singapore is also making good strides towards its target of “80-80-80 in 2023” — a long-term plan to green 80% of all buildings, get 80% of new developments to be certified Super Low-Energy, and achieve an 80% improvement in energy-efficiency.Halyday says that the government’s push towards sustainability has caused a growing awareness and adoption of green building practices. “For example, the key criterion for the award of new data centres following the Data Centre moratorium in Singapore was that of sustainability, with several submissions proposing state-of-the-art sustainability solutions.”Beyond a top-down approach, Khoo says that key developers need to take the lead, so that sustainable practices can be adopted holistically further down the value chain rather than in isolation and solely for the benefit of one company.The year aheadThe construction sector has rounded the corner since 2022 when risk mitigation strategies and smart procurement routes became essential as global industry volatility impacted the prices of key construction materials, says Halyday. “But this year, we have seen improved market conditions (in the local market) with the levelling of prices of key commodities and the resumption of major projects including public housing,” he adds.As confidence in the construction industry in Singapore gathers pace, Halyday expects an increasing appetite for greener and modern construction methods in line with Singapore’s sustainable development agenda, as well as future-proofing operations against market headwinds.The availability of skilled labour will continue to limit the potential growth of the local construction industry, even as the government pushes for reform towards a more efficient and productive industry, says Foong. “The construction industry continues to suffer from a shortage of suitable employees and the problem of talent retention. We are seeing fewer graduates from local tertiary institutions, while the employment of graduates from overseas are dependent on work permit quota and/or approval of employment passes,” he says.Foong adds that demand for professional roles such as project managers, architects, engineers, and quantity surveyors will continue to be elevated, even as the majority of the industry players are going through digital transformation.Khoo: Higher financing costs will see greater caution among developers in project phasing. (Picture: Samuel Isaac Chua/The Edge Singapore)“With the general post-Covid-19 business environment stabilised in Singapore, the government is now putting a greater emphasis on moving forward with healthcare, transportation, infrastructure, and public housing projects,” says Khoo. He adds that tender price escalation is expected to continue, albeit at a slower rate, and this will inevitably place pressure on upcoming projects.Looking ahead, future construction projects will likely emerge in the data centre segment as Singapore further develops into a hub for the Asia Pacific region, while new opportunities will open up in the life sciences segment from pharmaceuticals opting to be located in Singapore, says Halyday. https://www.edgeprop.sg/property-news/contractors-and-developers-face-skilled-labour-crunch-and-high-costs-2024Tags: ConstructionFollow UsFollow our channels to receive property news updates 24/7 round the clock.EdgeProp TelegramEdgeProp FacebookSubscribe to our newsletterSubscribeAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementTop Articles1Hillhaven and The Arcady record sales of over 50 units each on launch weekend2Chinese couple buys two adjacent units at The Ritz-Carlton Residences for record $5,397 psf3GuocoLand-led consortium sole bidder for Marina Gardens Crescent white site at $984 psf ppr4Would the Orchard Boulevard site be awarded after Marina Gardens Crescent’s rejected bid? 5Residential transactions with contracts dated Jan 2 to 9 [DONE DEALS]Search Articles",Edge-Prop,Construction

In its latest Singapore market intelligence report, the consultancy says the growth points to signs of strength and stability within the sector.It forecasts the growth to continue, with total construction demand estimated to come in at between $27 billion and $32 billion this year, in line with projections by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) in January. “Despite challenges and uncertainties, the construction industry will likely outpace the wider economy this year,” says Turner & Townsend.Read also: Construction demand to reach $27 bil to $32 bil in 2023: BCAThe sector will be bolstered by pent-up demand for both public and private construction, including a robust pipeline for housing, redevelopment of old commercial premises and the recommencement of major projects that were halted during the pandemic. The bulk of anticipated construction work in 2023 is for residential, commercial, and infrastructure projects. (Find Singapore commercial properties with our commercial directory)AdvertisementIn addition, Singapore’s 2023 budget includes measures broadly aimed at increasing productivity – such as the $4 billion National Productivity Fund top-up, the new Enterprise Innovation Scheme, and the $1 billion boost to the Singapore Global Enterprises initiative – which will help refresh infrastructure and key construction priorities.While the local construction sector has room to grow, Turner & Townsend highlights it remains vulnerable to global challenges such as high inflation and rising interest rates. “This uncertainty has resulted in construction costs remaining high despite a year-on-year decrease in prices for steel bars (13.9%) and concreting sand (1.7%), holding back a rebound in other types of construction projects,” adds the report.To overcome headwinds and spur the industry’s rate of recovery, the consultancy calls for more investment in collaborative contracting, which promotes closer consultation among stakeholders.“To prepare for the future and meet construction needs, better collaboration across the supply chain is critical in driving towards an advanced and integrated sector,” says Khoo Sze Boon, Turner & Townsend’s managing director for Singapore and Vietnam. “By embracing new ways of working, such as collaborative contracting, it could herald a new level of partnership and industry cooperation.”Turner & Townsend notes that the government is already taking steps to encourage collaboration, with the BCA recently refreshing the Built Environment Industry Transformation Map (ITM) to combine the previous Construction and Real Estate (Facilities Management) ITMs into a single map focusing on a value-chain approach.“Adopting the latest frameworks and technologies will help our industry improve efficiency and productivity, driving greater value into projects big and small across the city. To transform Singapore’s Built Environment for tomorrow, we need to drive collaborative contracting efforts today,” says Khoo.Advertisementhttps://www.edgeprop.sg/property-news/collaborative-contracting-could-re-energise-singapore%E2%80%99s-construction-recovery-turner-townsendTags: SingaporeconstructionTurner & TownsendFollow UsFollow our channels to receive property news updates 24/7 round the clock.EdgeProp TelegramEdgeProp FacebookSubscribe to our newsletterSubscribeAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementTop Articles1Hillhaven and The Arcady record sales of over 50 units each on launch weekend2Chinese couple buys two adjacent units at The Ritz-Carlton Residences for record $5,397 psf3GuocoLand-led consortium sole bidder for Marina Gardens Crescent white site at $984 psf ppr4Would the Orchard Boulevard site be awarded after Marina Gardens Crescent’s rejected bid? 5Residential transactions with contracts dated Jan 2 to 9 [DONE DEALS]Search Articles",Edge-Prop,Construction

4,What’s in store for Singapore’s construction sector and commodity prices,"What’s in store for Singapore’s construction sector and commodity pricesBy Michael Murphy, Linesight / EdgeProp Singapore | June 1, 2023 8:00 AM SGTThe construction industry is expected to grow at a 5.4% annual rate in 2023, due to planned public housing projects (Photo: Samuel Isaac Chua/EdgeProp Singapore)Join our  Telegram  channel and follow our  Facebook  for the latest update.SINGAPORE (EDGEPROP) - Singapore’s GDP is expected to grow at 1.5% in 2023, down from 3.6% in 2022. The slowing growth is primarily due to a manufacturing contraction amid a global slowdown. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has stopped tightening and maintains its exchange rate policy band. The Consumer Price Index (CPI-All) is still expected to be high in 2023, with the MAS projecting inflation to be in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%.Last year, the construction sector in Singapore experienced a real-term expansion of 6.6%, which can be attributed to the uptick in consumer and investor confidence, along with the easing of Covid-19-related travel and business restrictions.The industry is also expected to grow at a 5.4% annual rate in 2023 due to planned public housing projects. The industry still faces challenges such as labour shortages and high prices. However, conditions are improving, and the industry is expected to regain momentum in the medium to long term.AdvertisementSource: LinesightSource: LinesightLumber Lumber prices have remained stable but elevated and are likely to stay within a range in the coming quarters. This is due to consistent demand driven by incentives for sustainable construction through the use of engineered lumber and the expansion in residential construction, which is recovering from the 2020 slump.Cement and aggregates After rising sharply in the first half of last year, cement prices have remained elevated, held up by high production costs and improving demand. Construction output is expanding following the sharp slump in 2020, with particularly strong growth in investment in infrastructure and residential, and this will contribute to upward pressure on cement and aggregate prices.Concrete blocks and bricks Brick prices have been relatively stable, but with construction demand picking up, there will be increased upward pressure on prices in the coming quarters.Steel (rebar and structural) Having dropped throughout the second half of last year and into early 2023, steel prices are set to pick up again, buoyed by rising demand, with the commencement of works on a number of large civil engineering projects. Given the expansion in China's demand, demand across the region will also pick up. Raw material prices are set to remain volatile but are not returning to the highs of the first half of 2022.Copper Copper prices rose sharply in January 2023 as global copper demand strengthened, owing in part to China’s reopening following the end of its zero-Covid policy. Prices did slow in the period from January to March 2023. However, despite the drop, prices remained high on a quarterly basis. Domestic copper prices will also rise in the long run as a result of public infrastructure development projects under Singapore’s Green Plan 2030.Source: LinesightMichael Murphy is the director of South East Asia at Linesight (Source: Linesight)https://www.edgeprop.sg/property-news/what%E2%80%99s-store-singapore%E2%80%99s-construction-sector-and-commodity-pricesTags: constructioncommoditiesFollow UsFollow our channels to receive property news updates 24/7 round the clock.EdgeProp TelegramEdgeProp FacebookSubscribe to our newsletterSubscribeAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementTop Articles1Hillhaven and The Arcady record sales of over 50 units each on launch weekend2Chinese couple buys two adjacent units at The Ritz-Carlton Residences for record $5,397 psf3GuocoLand-led consortium sole bidder for Marina Gardens Crescent white site at $984 psf ppr4Would the Orchard Boulevard site be awarded after Marina Gardens Crescent’s rejected bid? 5Residential transactions with contracts dated Jan 2 to 9 [DONE DEALS]Search Articles",Edge-Prop,Construction
