2,Singapore acquires first fully-electric cargo vessel,"

The Goal Zero Consortium, including corporations like SeaTech Solutions International (SeaTech), Shift Clean Energy, and Yinson GreenTech, has introduced the Hydromover, Singapore’s first all-electric cargo ship.
The lightweight, 18.5-metre Hydromover is Singapore’s first fully-electric cargo vessel. The vessel is designed with swappable battery solutions and can carry up to 25 tonnes of cargo.
The ship generates zero emissions and can potentially reduce operational costs by up to 50 per cent compared to conventional vessels due to improved energy efficiency and lower maintenance costs.
The vessel was Goal Zero’s submission and one of the proposals under the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) and Singapore Maritime Institute (SMI) joint Call-for-Proposals for the electrification of harbour craft to be awarded R&D grants from both the MPA Maritime Innovation and Technology (MINT) Fund and SMI Fund in August 2021.
The Hydromover is reportedly the first project to be ready for commercial trials.
