SUMMARY
Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted hospitals to respond with stringent
measures. Accurate estimates of costs and resources used in outbreaks can guide evalu-
ations of responses. We report on the ﬁnancial expenditure associated with COVID-19, the
bed-days used for COVID-19 patients and hospital services displaced due to COVID-19 in aSingapore tertiary hospital.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective cost analysis from January to December 2020 in
the largest public hospital in Singapore. Costs were estimated from the hospital per-spective. We examined ﬁnancial expenditures made in direct response to COVID-19;hospital admissions data related to COVID-19 inpatients; and the number of outpatient
and emergency department visits, non-emergency surgeries, inpatient days in 2020,
compared with preceding years of 2018 and 2019. Bayesian time-series was used to esti-mate the magnitude of displaced services.
Results: USD $41.96 million was incurred in the hospital for COVID-19-related expenses.
Facilities set-up and capital assets accounted for 51.6% of the expenditure; patient-caresupplies comprised 35.1%. Of the 19,611 inpatients tested for COVID-19 in 2020, 727
(3.7%) had COVID-19. The total inpatient- and intensive care unit (ICU)-days for COVID-19
patients in 2020 were 8009 and 8 days, respectively. A decline in all hospital services wasobserved from February following a raised disease outbreak alert level; most services
quickly resumed when the lockdown was lifted in June.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was ﬁrst reported to the
World Health Organization (WHO) from Wuhan, China, inDecember 2019 [ 1]. Caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the infection spread
worldwide within a few months and resulted in a global pan-
demic [ 2]. The ﬁrst documented case of COVID-19 was identiﬁed
in Singapore on 23
rdJanuary 2020 in a traveller from Wuhan,
China [ 3]. On 7thFebruary 2020 the Ministry of Health Singapore
(MOH) raised the Disease Outbreak Response Condition (DOR-SCON) alert level from yellow to orange (Supplementary data),
indicating the severe nature of COVID-19 and the increased risk
of community spread [ 4]. On 7
thApril 2020, the Singapore Gov-
ernment further announced a circuit breaker, which was
essentially a lockdown period aimed at minimizing movements
and interactions to limit the spread of community and dormitoryCOVID-19 cases that had been increasing since March 2020 [ 4]. As
a result of the circuit breaker, all schools and non-essential
businesses were closed, social gatherings were prohibited, and
residents were requested to stay home. The circuit breaker wasprogressively lifted from 1
stJune 2020, and non-essential serv-
ices were resumed in phases.
The spread of COVID-19 has placed healthcare systems under
immense pressure and imposed a considerable ﬁnancial
healthcare burden globally and in Singapore [ 5,6]. In addition to
the direct costs associated with the healthcare resource uti-lization in COVID-19 patients, hospitals need to respond withenhanced infection control measures such as screening, testing
and personal protective equipment (PPE), incur a reduction in
ward capacity, and add resources to emergency department,patient isolation facilities and intensive care units (ICUs) [ 4,6,7].
Moreover, hospitals also defer or cancel elective procedures and
other ‘non-essential’ services, resulting in potential reductionsin hospital revenue and impact on patient outcomes [ 6,8,9].
For decision makers to effectively plan for funds and
resource allocation in future outbreaks, it is useful to under-stand the costs and resources used in managing contemporary
outbreaks [ 10]. This is because the management of outbreaks
takes up scarce healthcare resources which are inevitablydiverted from other health programmes. There is limited localdata available describing the costs and resource utilization for
COVID-19. The aim of this study was to describe the direct
expenditures incurred in the prevention or management ofCOVID-19, number of bed-days used in COVID-19 patients, and
changes in hospital services due to COVID-19 in a large tertiary
hospital in Singapore.
Materials and methods
Study design and setting
We conducted a retrospective cost analysis from the hos-
pital’s perspective in Singapore General Hospital, which is thelargest public hospital in Singapore. The 1900-bed tertiary
acute-care hospital, which provides a comprehensive range ofmedical services including oncological and haematologicalservices, solid organ transplant, and tertiary burns manage-
ment, accounted for approximately 15% of all acute-care hos-
pital beds in Singapore in 2019. The hospital has an isolationward consisting of 35 single rooms and 16 beds in cohort-rooms,
with negative-pressure infection isolation capabilities. In 2018
and 2019, the hospital had an inpatient occupancy rate of84.4% and 82.7%, respectively. Most of the annual budget is
provided by the government through block-based and/or
activity-based funding; less than 13% is derived from theadmission of private patients [ 11]. Our study was reviewed by
the institutional ethics review board (CIRB ref. 2020/2089).
Given the use of de-identiﬁed data exclusively, informed con-sent was waived.
Measures adopted by the hospital because of the
COVID-19 pandemic
a.Overview of government response
On 7thFebruary 2020, the Singapore government raised the
DORSCON level from yellow to orange after the ﬁrst COVID-19
community transmission cases were conﬁrmed (Supple-mentary data). This was quickly followed a circuit breaker on
7
thApril 2020, where schools and all non-essential services
were halted [ 12].
b.Healthcare workers
In response to the DORSCON orange status, several pro-
tective measures, which were escalated/de-escalated inresponse to the rapidly evolving epidemiology of the pandemic,were implemented across the hospital. Mask wearing and twice
daily temperature checks were mandated for staff. Staff who
developed fever or respiratory symptoms had to visit the staffclinic, where a COVID-19 swab test was performed and a ﬁve-
day medical leave was mandated. Local conferences and ofﬁ-
cial overseas trips were cancelled. Staff returning from high-risk countries were placed on a mandatory 14-day quar-
antine. Vacation leave was cancelled for all staff to allow for
rapid deployment for COVID-19-related processes. Inter-hospital movement of patients and healthcare workers wasrestricted.
c.Outpatient and emergency department
The number of hospital visitors was restricted. Temperature
screening stations and questionnaires were set-up at all hos-
pital entrances to determine the visitors’ travel history, con-
tact history and presence of acute respiratory symptoms (ARI).Dedicated ‘fever areas’ were set up at the emergency
department, so that high-risk patients presenting with fever,Y. Cai et al. / Journal of Hospital Infection 121 (2022) 1 e8 2 respiratory symptoms, or epidemiologic risk factors were sep-
arated from the common waiting areas and tested for COVID-19
using oropharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 PCR [ 13]. Strict
limitations were placed on outpatient and elective surgeryservices [ 14]. For patients requiring repeat medications, the
hospital’s pharmacy instituted electronic ﬁlling of pre-
scriptions with home delivery [ 15]. Gradual resumption of
outpatient and elective surgeries were allowed when the cir-cuit breaker was lifted efrom 1
stJune 2020, specialist out-
patient visits and medical procedures were ﬁrst resumed with
teleconsultation being the preferred mode of service provision;from 19
thJune 2020, screening services and pre-employment
check-up were also resumed.
d.Inpatient
The measures taken in the inpatient setting were described
by Wee et al. [7]. Brieﬂy, patients presenting with ARI and high
COVID-19 risk were admitted to isolation wards, while thosewith ARI and low COVID-19 risk were placed in ARI wards con-
verted from general wards [ 7]. Oropharyngeal COVID-19 swabs
for SARS-CoV-2 PCR were regularly performed for all patients inARI wards and isolation wards [ 7]. An infection control bundle,
comprising infrastructural enhancements, improved PPE,
environmental surveillance, patient surveillance and social
distancing was implemented in ARI wards. As part of the pan-demic preparedness response, the hospital additionally set up
a new isolation facility with 50 isolation single rooms to ensure
that the hospital had reserve capacity to respond to a full-blown community outbreak.
e.External facilities
COVID-19 testing services and medical services were
extended by the hospital to external facilities [ 16]. This
included eight dormitories where the COVID-19 outbreak were
predominantly occurring, two swab isolation facilities, and onecommunity care facility (CCF) housing low-risk COVID-19patients. In the CCF, healthcare staff provided round-the-clock
essential primary care and medical consultation. Pharmacists
stocked key essential medications, packaged and dispensedthem remotely [ 16].Data sources
Direct expenditure associated with the management or
prevention of COVID-19 from January 2020 to December 2020,
including costs expended for the support of community COVID-19 operations, was obtained from the hospital’s ﬁnancedepartment. These costs were classiﬁed as: capital assets and
facilities set-up for the prevention or management of COVID-
19, labour-related costs, patient-care-related materials andsupplies, and non-patient-care materials, related to the pre-
vention or management of COVID-19, and costs associated
with services for external facilities. All costs were presentedin 2020 US dollars (USD) (1 Singapore dollar ¼1.354 USD).
Time losses in existing healthcare staff or time spent by
existing healthcare staff redeployed for COVID-19 relatedprocesses and overhead costs were not considered as thesewere deemed to be sunk costs. Lost revenue due to deferment
of services was also not included as it was not deemed to be
direct expenditure. Data on patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from January to December 2020 were identiﬁed from the
hospital’s electronic database. Data collected were length of
inpatient stay and length of stay in the ICU, number of COVID-19 tests done, and discharge status. To describe changes in
hospital services due to COVID-19, weekly data pertaining to
number of outpatient visits, non-emergency surgeries, inpa-tient days, and emergency department visits for 2020 and the
preceding years of 2018 and 2019 were extracted from the
hospital’s database.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed in R software (R Core
Team (2020). R: A language and environment for statisticalcomputing; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,
Austria. URL https://www.R-project.org/ ). We employed
descriptive statistics to summarize the hospitalization charac-teristics and costs. Frequency and percentages were reported
for categorical variables. Mean (95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs))
or median (ﬁrst quartile ethird quartile) were reported for
continuous variables. Changes in hospital services associated
with COVID-19 were explored by reporting the average weekly
numbers along with 95% CIs in a Bayesian time series model [ 17].

Figure 1. Timeline of COVID-19 in Singapore in 2020. Based on the timeline, a total of three time periods were modelled in the time-
series analysis: (1) pre-COVID-19 phase; (2) circuit breaker phase (encompasses the start of Disease Outbreak Response Condition
(DORSCON) Orange and circuit breaker); and (3) post circuit breaker COVID-19 phase. The entire period from the start of DORSCON Orangeto the end of 2020 was modelled as ‘COVID-19’ period in the time-series analysis. MOH, Ministry of Health, Singapore.Y. Cai et al. / Journal of Hospital Infection 121 (2022) 1 e8 3 Four time-periods were considered in the time series, as shown
inFigure 1 : before the DORSCON Orange status was termed pre-
COVID-19 period, announcement of the DORSCON Orange and
the subsequent circuit breaker was termed circuit breakerperiod, the lifting of the circuit breaker to the end of 2020 was
termed post-circuit-breaker period, and the entire period from
announcement of DORSCON Orange to the end of 2020 wastermed COVID-19 period. To determine the relative effect ofCOVID-19 pandemic on the reduction in hospital services in each
time period compared with the pre-COVID-19 period, analyses
were conducted using the ‘bsts’ and ‘CausalImpact’ packages[17]. The ‘CausalImpact’ package provides an estimate of the
absolute and relative effect of an intervention in a targeted time
series by analysing the difference between a forecasted coun-terfactual model and the actual model [ 17]. A two-sided P-value
of/C200.05 was signiﬁcant.
Results
Actual expenditure associated with COVID-19
The response to the pandemic incurred USD $45.39 million
cash expenditures with USD $3.43 million (7.6%) for servicesrendered to support community COVID-19 operations and USD
$41.96 million (92.4%) for hospital-based services. Table I is an
itemized listing of COVID-19 related expenditures in 2020.Facilities set-up and purchase of capital assets in response to
the pandemic was USD $21.67 million and accounted for 51.6%
of the in-hospital expenditure. Patient-care-related suppliesand services were USD $14.72 million and accounted for 35.1%
of the in-hospital expenditure. The largest single item category
of expenditure incurred was medical supplies at USD $14.08million, which accounted for 33.6% of all in-hospital expendi-ture. Expenditure for labour costs comprised mainly of wages
of newly hired staff in response to the pandemic and overtime
wages and this was 62.2% of all in-hospital labour-related costs.
Patients hospitalized with COVID-19
From January to December 2020, 35,205 COVID-19 test
swabs was performed on 19,611 patients admitted to the hos-
pital. Of the 19,611 patients tested for COVID-19, 727 (3.7%)were positive for COVID-19. The median length of hospital stayof COVID-19 patients was eight days (6 e13 days). Of the 727
COVID-19 patients, only three (0.4%) were admitted to the ICU
for a median of two days (1 e5 days). The total number of
inpatient and ICU days for COVID-19 patients in 2020 was 8009
days and eight days, respectively. This accounted for 0.7% and
0.02% of the hospital’s total inpatient and ICU bed-days in2020, respectively.
Changes in hospital services associated with COVID-19
In response to the DORSCON orange status and the sub-
sequent implementation of circuit breaker, we observedreductions in the frequency of hospital-based services for thecircuit breaker period compared with the pre-COVID-19 period
in 2018 and 2019. The weekly trends for the services are shown
inFigure 2 , and a summary of the relative effects shown in
Table II . In the circuit breaker period, the greatest reduction
was observed for non-emergency surgeries (45%, P<0.001) andoutpatient visits (36%, P<0.001); inpatient days were reduced
by 11% ( P<0.001). Most services resumed in the post-circuit
breaker period, except for emergency department visits,
which remained signiﬁcantly lower (13%, P<0.001) compared
with the pre-COVID-19 period. When the entire COVID-19period was collectively compared with the pre-COVID-19
period, no signiﬁcant reduction was observed in inpatient
days (1%, P¼0.206). Non-emergency surgeries ( P<0.001) and
outpatient visits ( P<0.001) services were both reduced by 13%
when the entire COVID-19 period was compared with the pre-
COVID-19 period.

patients and changes in healthcare services due to the
COVID-19 pandemic in a tertiary hospital in Singapore. We
found that a small number of COVID-19 patients were admittedto the hospital in 2020, accounting for only 0.7% of all inpatient
bed-days. However, the actual expenditure incurred by the
hospital was substantial, mainly due to costs in facilities set-up, capital assets and medical supplies for prevention ormanagement of COVID-19. While we did not tabulate the actual
costs associated with lost opportunities due to missed revenue,
we observed signiﬁcant reduction in volumes in all hospitalservices during the circuit breaker period compared with the
pre-COVID-19 period.
In 2003, Singapore was one of the countries most affected by
the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak [ 18].
The experience has led local hospitals to adopt a prudent
approach in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 [ 19].
However, the stringent infection prevention measures trans-
lated to high expenditures incurred by the hospital. Notably,
facilities set-up for infection prevention and purchase of cap-ital assets in response to the pandemic accounted for morethan half of the COVID-19-related expenditure. Interestingly,
labour-related costs incurred by the hospital were modest. This
is likely attributed to the fact that opportunity costs associatedwith lost clinical time due to redeployment of staff for COVID-
19-related processes were not included in our tabulation of
direct hospital expenditure. In the two months before circuitbreaker was announced, clinical and non-clinical hospital staff
were trained to manage fever screening areas and had con-
ducted full-scale simulations as part of the hospital’s Prepar-edness and Response plan, Upon circuit breaker
announcement, existing hospital staff were quickly redeployed
to manage COVID-19-related processes, and were also sepa-rated into multiple teams to allow for longer shift hours and toensure business continuity should any staff be quarantined due
to COVID-19 [ 13,20,21].
Despite being the largest Singapore tertiary acute care
hospital with 15% of all Singapore inpatient beds in 2019, only
727 (1.2%) of 58,599 COVID-19 patients in Singapore in 2020
were admitted to our study hospital. There are two reasons forsmall number of COVID-19 patients in our hospital: ﬁrstly,
large-scale dedicated isolation units termed CCFs have been
set up to house low-risk COVID-19 patients to prevent thenation’s healthcare infrastructure from becoming over-whelmed [ 16]. Secondly, patients who presented at primary
care clinics fulﬁlling criteria for COVID-19 and requiring hos-
pitalization were predominantly sent to the National Centre forInfectious Diseases, which is a 330-bedded high-level isolation
hospital purpose built for infectious diseases and outbreak
management. Of the 727 patients that were admitted, onlythree were admitted to the ICU during their stay. This is likely
because almost 95% of the infected patients in Singapore in
2020 comprised migrant workers in their 20s or 30s with little orno comorbidities, in which the likelihood of severe disease is
markedly lower compared with elderly individuals or those
with comorbidities [ 22]. Previous studies have estimated that
the direct medical cost of a COVID-19 patient to range from USD$3,000 to USD $12,000 per patient in USA [ 5,23]. While we did
not estimate the average direct medical costs of each COVID-19
patient, we observed that the expenditure for medical suppliesand pharmaceutical products in COVID-19 prevention or man-
agement was almost USD $15 million despite the small numberTable II

Figure 2. Actual weekly data (solid line) versus predicted (dashed line) with 95% conﬁdence interval for (a) non-emergency surgeries; (b)
Emergency Department visits; (c) outpatient visits; and (d) inpatient bed-days. Signiﬁcant drops were observed for all services during the
circuit breaker phase, following the Disease Outbreak Response Condition (DORSCON) Orange alert.Y. Cai et al. / Journal of Hospital Infection 121 (2022) 1 e8 6 of COVID-19 patients. We found that this was because all
patients presenting with acute respiratory disease, including
those without travel history or prior known contact with COVID-
19 patients, were considered to be at risk of having COVID-19.Hence, dedicated wards, termed ARI wards, were set up to
segregate these patients from the rest of the hospital. In these
ARI wards, extensive infection control measures, includinginfrastructural enhancement and social distancing, risk strati-ﬁed PPE use, enhanced cleaning and sanitation, and regular
testing for COVID-19 infection was instituted, which con-
tributed to the COVID-19-related medical supplies expenditureincurred by the hospital [ 7].We consider our costs estimates to
be conservative as we did not include costs that were not a
direct part of the infection control measures. For instance,costs associated with the implementation of services to provide
alternative methods of care, such as remote counselling and
teleconsultation clinics during the circuit breaker phase wereexcluded from our cost estimates.
Previous studies have suggested that the monetary losses of
clinical and surgical revenues due to reduction in hospitalservices are likely to eclipse the direct ﬁnancial expenditures inan outbreak [ 6,10,24]. Mulholland et al. described overall sharp
drops in emergency department, inpatient admissions, and
surgical admissions in Scotland hospitals following the WHOCOVID-19 pandemic announcement and the consequent UK
lockdown [ 8]. In our study, we similarly observed reductions in
all hospital services following the declaration of the DORSCONorange status and subsequent circuit breaker. Notably, approx-
imately one-third of all outpatient services and almost half of
non-emergency surgeries were cancelled during the circuitbreaker period, which may result in lost clinical revenue. How-
ever, this loss is likely to be low considering that most of hos-
pital’s revenue is derived from annual block funding from thegovernment, which is not directly affected by patient volume[11]. Most services rallied after the circuit breaker was lifted
likely due to pent-up demand; hence, the onset of COVID-19 in
2020 resulted in approximately only 10% reduction in servicescompared with the pre-COVID-19 period. Despite this, it should
be noted that to allow business continuity during the COVID-19
pandemic, hospitals can incur higher costs in service provisiondue to the need for additional infection prevention measures
such as increased COVID-19 testing, more stringent use of PPEs,
and reduced visits for social distancing [ 14].
Our study has limitations. We did not quantify the costs
associated with lost revenue due to the lack of data informing
the clinical revenue associated with each service. However, we
postulated that this loss in revenue is likely to be modestconsidering the minimal reduction in overall service provision
by the hospital in 2020 and the funding mechanism of the
hospital. Another limitation is that our ﬁndings may be lessgeneralizable for other healthcare systems in other countries
with different policy responses against COVID-19, or for
healthcare systems with different payment structures. Never-theless, we believe that our ﬁndings are valuable in informing
local healthcare administrators and decision makers in sub-
sequent responses in future pandemics. Our study also did notconsider the wider socio-economic impact of COVID-19,including its impact on healthcare workers’ well-being and
productivity. In a survey by Tan et al. , it was reported that
burnout and disengagement was observed in three-quarters ofsurveyed healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic
[25]. The efﬁcacy and cost-effectiveness of methods to supportthe mental well-being of healthcare workers, such as mobile
health apps, may be of interest in future studies [ 26]. Finally,
continued analysis of the hospital costs will be warranted, as
cost structures will change when hospitals evolve from thetraditional face-to-face patient ephysician care model to novel
models of remote consultations, such as the use of artiﬁcial
intelligence or machine learning for automated clinical diag-nosis and home-based monitoring [ 27].
In conclusion, in our study, we found that the prevention
and management of the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with
high ﬁnancial expenditure to Singapore hospitals. Whilehealthcare services were disrupted during lockdown, these
services quickly rallied after the lockdown was lifted. Given
that we are still in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, it isuncertain how subsequent waves of infection or changes in
vaccination rates may impact hospital responses and costs.
Understanding the key costs in the response to the COVID-19pandemic can enable us to make better-informed decisions
as we prepare to respond to future epidemics.

The health care system in Singapore

Singapore has a compelling health policy story. In a nutshell, the population enjoys excellent health 
status while public and total expenditures on healthcare remain low .  Its achievements look all the more 
remarkable in comparison to its high income peers in OECD, as shown in the following table :

International benchmarking lend further credence to Singapore’s fine record . The Economist 
Intelligence Unit (2014) ranks its health system the second best (after Japan) out of 166 in the world. 
Similarly, the Bloomberg Health- Care Efficiency Index  2017 ranks it second best among 55 countries .  
Like all good stories, there are vill ains and heroes in the Singapore story: market competition 
and medical savings account  are the heroes  that fight off the evils of information asymmetry 
and moral hazards that are the bane of healthcare  systems. The remarkable headline  numbers 
and the accompanying narrative have attracted widespread admiration  from commentators 
around the world in recent years  (For example, see Callick 2008; Haseltine, 2013; Gobry 2014; 
Doutthat 2017] .  
Alas, if only healthcare  policy were so simple. The reality is mess y and there is no magic bullet. 
Singapore’s suc cess in healthcare is built on a panoply of measures developed and refined over 
decades. The measures employ a variety of policy tools that both individually and collectively 
target the market and government failures afflict the healthcare sector.  For a comprehensive 
understanding of health policy in Singapore, we need to understand all the policy tools used and how they operate individually and in relation to each other .  
For start ers, the Singapore government intervenes heavily and comprehensively in the health 
sector, especially after the unsatisfactory experience with corporatisation , deregulation and 
marketi sation of the sector in the mid -1980s which saw massive rise in costs and public disquiet 
(Ramesh, 2008A). The 1993 White Paper, which critically reviewed the 1980s reforms, bluntly noted: “Market forces alone will not suffice to hold down medical costs to the minimum…. In healthcare, s upply tends to create its own demand, thus raising healthcare expenditure. The 
Government therefore needs to intervene to prevent an oversupply of services, to dampen unnecessary demand and ultimately, to control costs” (Government of Singapore, 1993). The  
report particularly emphasi sed the need to regulate fees charged by providers and control the 
supply of hospital beds and physicians. It also boldly addressed the delicate issue of rationing demand: “We cannot avoid rationing medical care, implicitly or e xplicitly …. To get the most 
from the limited health budget, we need to exclude treatments which are not sufficiently cost effective to belong to the basic health package available to all.” (Government of Singapore, 
1993, p. 24). In the following years, the government refined its health policy interventions that 
involved vast expansion in the range of tools it employed to manage the sector. The underlying trend in the choice of tools was their focus on addressing specific governance problems rather 
than promoting the role of the market or the state.  
The policy tools currently used to manage the healthcare  sector in Singapore are summarised 
in Figure 1. The tools include a variety of regulatory, organi sational, fiscal, and information 
tools with the Ministry of Health (MOH) at the helm. Collectively, they form a 
counterweighing system of incentives and disincentives that encourage the key stakeholders to pursue cost -effectiveness, make prudent economic decisions without compromising the overall 
policy goals of  providing necessary healthcare to all at affordable costs.

Organi sational Tools  
A distinct feature of Singapore’s health system is the overwhelming dominance of the 
government in hospital ownership, with public hospitals accounting for more than four -fifths 
of all hospital beds in the country.  
Similar to many other countries, Singapore began reforming its public hospitals in the mid -
1980s in the face of mounting public expenditures on health. Pursuing cost reduction through enhanced efficiency, the reforms promoted competition among hospitals and operational autonomy for managers. Competition was also intended to promote customer -focus, as public 
hospitals were viewed unfavourably by users.  
The award of autonomy to public hospitals and competition among them did indeed improve service quality an d cleared surgery backlogs but it also increased costs and reduced 
affordability (Ramesh, 2008A). The adverse trends led the government in the 1990s to intervene in all significant aspects of hospitals’ operations, their autonomy notwithstanding: 
the types  and volume of speciali sed clinical services they provide, the fees they charge, the 
salaries they pay, and the expensive equipment they purchase. It also tweaked the formula by 
which it paid hospitals, to ensure that hospitals did not under - or over -suppl y services.  
In 1999, the government established two similarly sized “clusters” of vertically integrated 
public hospitals and clinics. The reorgani sation was intended to promote econom ies of scale, 
effective coordination and planning of resources, better integration of inpatient and outpatient facilities, and a more effective patient referral system within each cluster. Notwithstanding 
government ownership, each public hospital is a legall y autonomous entity registered as a 
private firm. Legally, they enjoy operational autonomy in all areas, including recruitment, remuneration, purchase, and pricing of services. They also have substantial revenues and surplus from treating patients in non- subsidi sed wards which reinforces their autonomy. Yet 
the fact that the government remains the owner means that it can control and direct them, if necessary, in ways not possible if they were truly private firms. Inspired by the success of two Government    
 
4 
 
competing clu sters, and seeking to further enhance competition, in 2015 all public hospitals 
and associated polyclinics were reorgani sed as 6 regional clusters spread across the island.  
“Public ownership of what are legally private firms allows hospitals the autonomy they need to operate 
in a competitive environment and yet be within the government’s direct reach.”  
Public ownership of what are legally private firms allows hospitals the autonomy they need to 
operate in a competitive environment and  yet be within the government’s direct reach (Ramesh, 
2008B). It provides the government a channel for receiving market feedback and a tool for controlling hospitals’ behaviour. As an owner, the government can shape hospitals’ behaviour without having to resort to onerous regul ations or purchase negotiations that would be 
necessary if they were truly private firms. This has been particularly useful for controlling user charges, physicians’ remunerations, and the number of hospital beds in different ward classes, 
for instance . 
 
Fiscal tools  
Tax financing for healthcare  in Singapore consists of two components: transfers to public 
hospitals to subsidise the costs of care for patients who do not pay the full costs of treatment, 
and tax exemptions for Medisave contributions (Tan et al  2014). Such transfers account for 25 
per cent of total health expenditure and 70 per cent of the government’s health expenditure (Ramesh 2008A). The government pays public hospitals on the basis of case -mix (diagnosis -
related groups or DRGs) as well as bl ock grants. In the 1990s when the formula for grants was 
changed from block grants based largely on historical figures to fee -for-service, hospitals 
predictably increased the quantity of services they provided. As a result, in 1999 the government introduce d case- mix funding to create incentives for hospitals to make better use 
of resources. To prevent under -servicing – a problem innate to case- mix because providers are 
paid a fixed amount per case regardless of the services they provide – the government 
subsequently moved to a hybrid system, comprising both block funding and case -mix payment 
(Khaw 2005).  
In addition to subsidies at public hospitals, there are many ad- hoc tax -financed schemes. 
Community Health Assistant Schemes , for instance, is a income -tested scheme that offers 
additional grants to low -income household for outpatient treatment. Similarly, Pioneer 
Generation Package  subsidises insurance premiums as well as reduces co -payments for elderly 
Singaporeans. There are  also public health campaigns fully financed by the government.  
In 1984, Singapore established Medisave, which was then considered an unconventional financing scheme based on compulsory savings. The government’s objective in launching the scheme was to encourage individual responsibility for healthcare, while reducing the government’s fiscal responsibility (Taylor and Blair, 2003). After an episode of hospitalisation, the patient is issued with an itemised bill which can be settled directly from balances in  an 
individual’s Medisave account, subject to a co- payment of 20 percent paid out of pocket  
(OOP) , in addition to daily and annual limits on withdrawal. The mandatory nature of Medisave 
and restrictions on what it can be used for has resulted in relatively  large accumulated balances: 
total Medisave balances amounted to S$70 billion or equivalent 18 percent of GDP in 2015. However, after more than three decades of operation and a comparatively high contribution   
 
5 
 
rate, Medisave forms less than 10 percent of total healthcare spending (Government of 
Singapore, 2015).  
Medishield, introduced in 1990 and replaced by Medishield Life in 2015, is a low -cost and 
basic health insurance scheme for catastrophic hospital costs. It was introduced after the 
realisation that Medisave was insufficient to pay large hospital bills. It is a voluntary scheme 
(with an opt -out provision) intended to cover those up to the age of 92 years, though new 
enrolment is not allowed after the age of 75 years. The premiums vary by age and are s ubsidised 
based on the income. Thus, the annual premium for Medishield, for example, ranges from $50 for those under the age of 20 years to $1,190 for those between the age of 84 and 85. For patients seeking more generous cover or treatment in upper class hospital wards, additional cover may be purchased from authorised private insurance schemes. The premium for Medishield can be paid from Medisave accounts. There are high deductibles ($1,000 per year for a Class C ward and $1,500 for other wards) and co- insurance requirements (10–20% of the 
hospital bill). In March 2015, Medishield covered 3.6 million individuals and spending through formed less than 5 percent of total healthcare spending.  
Medifund was established as a means -tested scheme in 1993 to fill the gaps left by Medisave 
and Medishield. In the absence of risk pooling and cross -subsidi sation, those with low life -time 
incomes or the poor accumulate lower balances in their Medisave account, which in turn determines their access to medical services. Medifund caters to those who do not have the means to pay for their health bills from OOP or Medisave or Medishield. However, Medifund accounts for a negligible share of total healthcare expenditure as the means test is onerous. In 
2014, S$133 million were distributed amongst 766,000 applicants, an average of about S$170 
per applicant.  
OOP payments are large in Singapore, and is an outcome of deliberate policy design. There is almost no entirely free healthcare in Singapore: everyone is expected to pay all or part of the 
costs, including hospital care. Outpatient care, including at the polyclinics, is funded largely OOP . The adverse effects of OOP are mitigated by lower prices at government owned and 
operated polyclinics due to economies of scale and cost -cutting management practices. The 
lower prices at government clinics have the flow -on effect of driving down prices at private 
clinics to whom they pose latent competition.  
 
Regulatory tools  
A key feature of Singapore’s healthcare system is the tight control over access to services. To 
achieve this, policymakers rely on both demand-  and supply -side controls to encourage patients 
and providers to be judicious and cost conscious in their use of healthcare services. For 
instance, Medishield covers hospitalisation only in basic hospital wards, and prices increase 
steeply if patients seek treatment in higher class wards, as subsides decline with the ward class, being zero for the highest (i.e. the most comfor table) Class A ward. Similarly, access to 
advanced tertiary care or diagnostic tests is rationed by waiting times if treatment is to be reimbursed by Medisave and Medishield. While patients have immediate access to tertiary hospitals and specialists, they do not receive subsidised prices in the absence of referrals. 
Restrictions on the use of Medisave as well as ceilings on the maximum amount that providers   
 
6 
 
can be paid from an individuals Medisave account reduce the malfeasance associated with 
moral hazard.  The MOH  is known to closely monitor billing practices of hospitals and raises 
alarms when it observes anomalies or suspected excessive treatment.  
Singapore Medical Council, a statutory board under the MOH regulates and licenses healthcare  
providers in Si ngapore. The Council plays an active role in ensuring that costs are 
‘competitively priced’ and in the stewardship of the sector. There have been instances where 
the Council has censured providers for ‘over -charging’ patients (Straits Times, 2015). Such 
controls on provider behaviour reduce their monopoly power in the health sector, and reduce 
room to engage in maleficent behaviour.  
 
Government encouraged hospital clusters to harmonise their financial, clinical, administ rative and diagnostic processes 
through integrated information systems.  
 
Information tools  
To take advantage of modern information technologies available for hospital management, the 
government has encouraged hospital clusters to harmoni se their financial, clinical, 
administrative and di agnostic processes through integrated information systems. All 16 public 
hospitals use the enterprise software, National Electronic Health Records. However, private hospitals, and more significantly, private clinics continue to resist sharing information w ith 
other providers.  
  
 
7 
 
An innovative measure the government has employed to improve service quality and lower 
prices is to acquire and disseminate information on hospital charges and clinical outcomes. As the Minister of Health put it: “For economics and mar kets to work, we must make sure that the 
conditions for market competition exist. That is why I published the bill sizes for the common medical treatments…. When competition is brought to bear on these services, we will then have the right incentives for t he healthcare providers to do the right thing, to raise standards 
even as they reduce cost” (Khaw, 2005). Since 2003, public hospitals have been required to publish their average bill sizes (which includes charges for room, treatment, surgery, laboratory test, etc.) for different common conditions and procedures. The collated data is subsequently 
published on the M OH’s webpage
. Information on the occupancy rates of hospital beds is 
updated on a weekly basis. Similarly, the Ministry also publishes the distribution of bills  across 
public hospitals for major illnesses . The hospital managers wer e understandably resistant to 
disclosing information on their charges and clinical outcomes but the government eventually prevailed over them. Private hospitals were more successful at resisting participation, but many 
eventually complied due to pressures from the government and users.  
Given the volume of data collected over the years, the M OH now maintains online calculators, 
which are synchronised with Medisave and Medishield limits. Patients may visit the website 
and estimate the cost of treatment of particular episodes of illness and calculate the share of the bill that may be financed by Medisave and Medishield. Importantly, they can make informed choices on the particular hospital and ward class  when  they seek treatment, based on their 
knowledge of average costs and clinical outcomes. The flow of information promoted by 
government measures mitigates users’ information disadvantage vis -à-vis providers.  
 
Concluding observations  
The first conclusion to emerge from the discussion above is that Singapore’s healthcare achievements 
are not the result of some magic bullet, Medisave or otherwise. Medisave forms less than a tenth of the 
country’s total health spending which would make it, prima facie, an unlikely determinant of the 
system’s outcomes. For a fuller understanding, we need to understand the entire range of policy 
measures that the government employs and how they target the various failures that afflict the sector.  
Furthermore , the case of Singapore shows that policy tools are more effecti ve when used 
simultaneously and in concert . A concerted use of different tools promote complementarities 
that are unavailable when they are used in isolation. Take the case of publicly owned and 
operated hospitals, a typical organi sational tool. Instead of  running them in traditional 
command -and-control ways, the Singapore government uses its ownership rights to force them 
to compete with each other and with private hospitals for users’ funds  with the objective of 
promoting customer focus and operational ef ficiency on their part . Its ownership also makes it 
easier for the government to force them to disclose information on costs and clinical outcomes, a requirement vehemently resisted by private hospitals but essential if users are to make informed decisions . Here we see an ingenious combination of public ownership, market 
competition, and price transparency to achieve different but related objectives. Public ownership also allows the Ministry to directly acquire operational information from public hospitals and respond with appropriate directives as necessary. This is particularly relevant in 
healthcare as the governance failures are multi -faceted and deeply intertwined and, hence,   
 
8 
 
cannot be addressed in isolation, as policy reformers in many countries have found out (Liang 
and Langenbrunner, 2013; Ramesh 2013; Bali and Ramesh, 2015b; Harimurti et al 2013).

Malaysia has a two‑tier health care system consisting of the public and private sectors. 
The Ministry of Health is the main provider of health care services in the country. The private health care sector provides services on a nonsubsidized, fee‑for‑service basis, and mainly serves for those who can afford to pay. For financing health care two types of health insurances are available currently: Private and employee based (aka SOCSO). SOCSO and Employee Provident Fund provide some coverage to private‑sector employees. There are several challenges in pure Bismarckian model (private insurance etc.) like smaller portion of total population will be “economically active,” international competition to attract firms, and maintain/increase employment will put downward pressure on labor taxes. How to sustain universal coverage in this context? In a population setting where unemployment is high informal sector, payroll taxes will not be a major source of funds. However, it is possible to create a universal health financing system by transforming the role of budget funding from directly subsidizing provision to subsidizing the purchase of services on behalf of the entire population. The integration of services between the public and private sector is very much needed, at a cost the people can afford. At present, there is no national health insurance scheme in place. Although there are many models proposed, the main question that the policymakers need to be aware of is that of the equity of access to holistic health services for all Malaysians.Health care financing in Malaysia: A  way forward

The public health care system largely funded by the 
government and financed mainly from public tax revenue.
[2] The private health care sector provides 
services on a nonsubsidized, fee -for-service basis, and 
mainly serves for those who can afford to pay. Health care services by private sectors are funded mainly by 
private health insurance, consumers’ out -of-pocket 
payment, and nonprofit institution.[3]
The two types of health insurances are available 
currently: Private and employee based  (aka SOCSO). 
SOCSO and Employee Provident Fund  (EPF) provide 
some coverage to private -sector employees.[3]
HEALTH CARE FINANCING MODELS
Health care systems are comprised of service delivery, financing, and economic policy models. Much of the literature depicts health delivery systems in terms of a national health system, social insurance, or private insurance model. Each model has various forms of financing such as general taxation, specific taxation, 
and private financing. A  nation’s health care system 
cannot be adequately supported with just one model.[5] 
The following types of models and country(s) adopted it in their health system.
National health model
Furthermore, known as the Beveridge model is characterized by health care coverage for all citizens by a central government. It is financed by general tax revenues. Central and regional governments either 
own or control health care providers. A  government 
controls service distribution and provider payments.[5] 
Examples of the national health model include Denmark, 
Ireland, New  Zealand, and the UK.[6,7]
Social insurance model
Furthermore, known as the Bismarck model is characterized by health care coverage that is funded by employer, individual, and private insurance funds. Government or private entities control and own 
factors of production. It is also referred to as tax -based 
insurance. The funding is derived from employment taxes.
[5] E.g., SOCSO and EPF in Malaysia. Examples 
of the social insurance model include Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxemburg, and the Netherlands.
[6-10]
Private insurance model
This model is characterized by employment -based 
or individual purchase of private health insurance financed by individual and/or employer contributions. 
Private entities operating in an open market own and 
manage service delivery and financing.[5] Examples 
of the private insurance model include Switzerland 
and the USA.[6,7]
The national health insurance model
This model is an amalgamation of both Beveridge and Bismarck. Payment comes from a government run insurance program that every citizen pays into. There is no requirement marketing in this model 
so there is no financial ground to deny claims. The 
single payer system has more market power to negotiate for lower prices from pharmaceutical 
companies and others.
The national health insurance  (NHI) system is found 
in Canada. Some newly industrialized countries such 
as Taiwan and South  Korea have also adopted this 
model.[11]
BEVERIDGE VERSUS BISMARCK
As mentioned in Table  1, service entitlement basis in 
Bismarck is based on the contribution person make 
toward the services required. Noncontributors cannot 
avail the service, whereas Beveridge model offers 
services only to the resident or citizen of the country. The funding base for Bismarck is the wages earned 
by the contributor’s; on the other hand, Beveridge 
uses all the public revenues like taxes from different 
sources. The insurer for the services in case of Bismarck 
is occupational and in Beveridge it’s provided by the state. Benefit package is explicit that is, stated clearly 
and in detail, leaving no room for confusion or doubt in 
Beveridge model and implicit that is, implied though not plainly expressed in Bismarck model. The management 
is independent in Bismarck model but it is with the government in case of Beveridge model. Providers of 
services in Bismarck are privately contracted and in Beveridge are salaried and publicly contracted.

FINANCING IN MALAYSIA
Of pocket payment for health care service is a major 
financial barrier to health care. High out of pocket 
payment for health care means that health care is like 
a market commodity. Those who are better -off can 
afford higher out of pocket payments for health care, 
use more medical care, or use private -sector providers, 
whereas the poor cannot afford to pay and even give 
up treatment. There is a huge increase health care cost 
in Malaysia every year.
TOWARD THE BEV‑MARCK OR BIS‑ERIDGE MODEL
Irrespective of the source of funds, we observe 
variations and innovations across models in the 
organization of pooling, mechanisms for purchasing 
of services, and ways that the entitlements and 
obligations of the population. Labeling a system as Beveridge or Bismarck is not especially useful.
Need for health care during the crisis increases, but 
public revenues decline. If public spending on health falls, the burden shifted to patients, who may either forego needed care or run a greater risk of incurring potentially catastrophic spending. Major cuts in public expenditure may result in disruption of continuity of care and deterioration of the quality of care.
Improving efficiency  (more health for the money) 
is essential to lessen severity of the tradeoffs by eliminate inappropriate and ineffective services, 
improve rational drug use  (including volume 
control), allocate more funds to primary care and outpatient care at the expense of hospitals, invest 
in infrastructure that is cost -effective to run, cut 
the volume of least cost -effective services, reduce 
unproductive administrative costs.
Main health financing tool for this is strategic 
purchasing  (pay for performance): Allocations of 
resources need to be linked with providers to measures 
of their performance and health needs of the population being served. Changing the incentive environment through tailored use of markets and planning. Strategic purchasing irrespective of the label attached to the system.
TOWARD BEV‑MARCK OR BIS‑ERIDGE 
MODEL: IMPLICATIONS OF CONVERGENCE
Current scenarios of health care financing reform are portraying the choice between general taxation 
(aka Beveridge model) and social health insurance 
(aka Bismarck model). A  single system for the entire 
population is needed. Key features include the role and gradual development of the compulsory health insurance fund as a single purchaser of health care 
services for the entire population using output -based 
payment methods. Complete restructuring of pooling arrangements from the former decentralized budgetary structure to a single national pool and establishment of an explicit benefit package. Central to the process was transformation of the role of general budget revenues, the main source of public funding for health from directly subsidizing the supply of services to subsidizing the purchase of services on behalf of the entire population by redirecting them into the health insurance fund. Through their approach to health financing policy, 
and pooling in particular funds, can be used in 
an explicitly complementary manner to enable the creation of a unified, universal system.
After analyzing the costs of insurers, employers, 
doctors, hospitals, nursing homes, and home -care 
agencies in USA it was found that administration 
consumes 31.0% of total health spending[12] and 
universal coverage system and a single payer in USA 
as in Canada can save administrative costs  (10% of 
total health spending) that would be enough to cover the expense of universal coverage.
[13]
A major portion of the health budget is consumed by utility costs reflects a health financing system 
characterized by incentives designed to meet the 
“needs” of the physical infrastructure, rather than 
the needs of the population. E.g., “more beds that a 
hospital have, the more staff positions it is allowed to have and the greater budget it receives.”
Single -payer NHI can recapture the wasted money. 
The potential savings on paperwork can save a huge amount per year. Mandatory NHI fund will be an effective reform. An important step for the transition to a universal system is the establishment of a single hospital information system for all patients regardless of their insurance status. Insurance package for the insured population will simply top up the existing budget flows to the public health care system.
In a population setting where much of the population 
is not employed in the formal sector, payroll taxes 
will not be a major source of funds. However, it is 
possible to create a universal health financing system  Verma, et al.: Health care financing in Malaysia96
Archives of Pharmacy Practice  Vol. 6  Issue 4  Oct-Dec 2015by transforming the role of budget funding from 
directly subsidizing provision to subsidizing the 
purchase of services on behalf of the entire population.
It is not necessary to choose between Beveridge 
and Bismarck; well -d efined policy can enable their 
complementary co -existence in a unified universal 
health system as “Single -payer NHI.”
CONCLUSION
With the transformation of health care services being 
planned, it is perceived that the integration of services between the public and private sector is very much needed, at a cost the people can afford. The major 
question that arises with the planned integration of 
services relates to the issue of who will bear the cost 
of services because, at present, there is no NHI scheme 
in place. Although there are many models proposed, 
the main question that the policymakers need to be aware of is that of the equity of access to holistic health 
services for all Malaysians.

Healthcare Financing: How should c osts shift from  private pockets to the public purse?  
 
 
Wanted: The cure for demographic, cost and distributional challenges  
 
In early 2013, Singapore’s Finance and Health Ministers  announced that the g overnment was 
reviewing the healthcare financing  framework with a view to having the State shoulder a larger 
share of healthcare costs. 1 When implemented , part of the costs (and risks) that are currently borne 
by individuals and families would  shift to the S tate and be borne by taxpayers  instead .  
 
Singapore, like other advanced economies, face multiple challenges , such as an ageing population, 
rising income inequality, and  healthcare inflation  (between 2006 and 2012, the healthcare CPI has 
increased by 19.8 percentage points ; see Exhibit 1 ).2 Increasingly, the  Government also faces 
challenges to its firm ideological position against  generous state welfare . The fundamental principles 
underlying Singapore’s welfare system  are personal and family responsibility , with the S tate 
providing a residual safety net. Where healthcare financing is concerned, this philosophy has led to 
growing  criticisms by citizens, pub lic commentators and scholars who argue that notwithstanding 
the excellent health outcomes  that Singapore achieves in spite of  low public spending,  the 
healthcare financing system  imposes potentially high risks and costs on bot h the individual and the 
family. It is also inequitable since wealthier individuals and their families are better equipped for the 
contingencies of life . 
 Yet, it is  unclear if there is sufficient support  and hence  demand for a different distribution of risks 
between state and citizens, for example,  one that is based on the principles of universalism (instead 
of means -tested as is common in Singapore), and of equality of access to a high quality of care – 
cornerstones of the welfare regime s of the  social democratic Nordic countries . Sustaining such a 
regime would require broad -based commitment to much higher level of taxes than many in 
Singapore are prepared to accept .  
 What this means is that policy makers reviewing the healthcare financin g framework have to grapple 
with  three key challenges: demography, costs and distribution effects. This main  objective of this 
case is to analyse how policy makers should review the healthcare financing system so that it is 
appropriate for an ageing populat ion, fiscally sustainable and economically fair from the standpoint 
of a broad range of actors –  citizens with unequal distributions of wealth and  health, medical care 
professionals, and insurers . The case approaches this task by, first, presenting  a brief history of

weakness es of the  extant financing  framework , and the new challenges that  health policymakers 
face as a result of the growing contentiousness of politics in Sin gapore. The case concludes with 
interventions that the healthcare policymaker can make.

Singapore’s Philosophy towards  Social  Welfare  and Healthcare  Financing  
 
Singapore’s philosophy to social welfare financing has been shaped largely by the beliefs of the 
leaders of the People’s Action Party  (PAP) , which has formed the government since Singapore 
achieved self- government in 1959. The first Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, often stressed that the 
western -styled  welfar e state was not viable  for Singapore because it bred dependency on the 
government  and led to wastage and over -consumption .   This belief has endured; subsequent  
generation s of PAP leaders have  adopted a n approach where  the individual , and not the state,  are 
expected to bear the  main  responsibility  for meeting his/her needs in  healthcare, retirement, 
unemployment  and other episodes of income volatility. The family is expected to buttress self -
reliance by providing care to its members, and by providing oppo rtunities for income and risk 
pooling at the household level. As a result of these normative principles , Singapore, in comparison to 
other advanced economies, provides relatively little by way of social protection and redistribution. 
There is no state pens ion, no automatic unemployment benefits, and little by way of 
intergenerational transfers  (except in education , and in the various endowment funds that the 
Government has established over the years ).  
 Although h ealthcare is subsidised, the government relies extensively on patient co -payments and 
other market mechanisms to ration demand and minimise  the moral hazard  of providing free  or 
heavily subsidised  healthcare. This reflects  the government’s thinking that though subsidies for 5% 5% 4% 4% 6% 6% 7% 6% 6% 6% 7% 7% 9% 8% 8% 10% 1,170  1,243  1,089  1,212  1,591  1,533  2,007

Government spending on healthcare  3 healthcare  are unavoidable , they “could be extremely wasteful and ruinous for the budget”.3 Instead 
of providing healthcare for free, in 1980 , Lee Kuan  Yew tasked his then -Health Minister, Goh Chok 
Tong, to establish “good health servi ces, with waste and costs kept in check by requi ring co -
payments from the user”.4 To be sure, Singaporeans were already familiar with the concept of co -
payments for healthcare well before 1980; co -payments were introduced in 1960, when the then 
newly -insta lled PAP government imposed a user charge of 50 cents for each attendance at 
government outpatient clinics.5 Prior to 1960, the healthcare financing framework in British -ruled 
Singapore was modelled  after Britain’s  National Health Service , that is,  health  services in 
government hospitals and outpatient clinic were provided for free.  
 
These incremental steps of cost shifting to the individual and the family culminated in the 1993 
White Paper on Affordable Healthcare6, in which  the Health Ministr y formally identified personal 
and family  responsibility as the cornerstone s of Singapore’s healthcare financing framework. Since 
then, p atient  co-payment has been beco me a central feature of Singapore’s healthcare  system. This 
approach  is widely seen  to be the main reason for  contain ing national and public spending on 
healthcare . Singapore’s national healthcare expenditure is about only 4 per cent of gross domestic 
product (GDP), with the state financing about a third (or slightly above 1 per cent of GDP) of costs – 
both very low by the standards of rich countries  (see Exhibit s 2 and 3 ). Healthcare costs in Singapore 
are also contained through the government’s supply side co ntrols  through limits on the number of 
medical graduates, fee controls , and the ownership of public hospitals. The principles articulated in 
the White Paper  continue to guide policymaking in Singapore.

As a result of these cost and risk -shifting policies, the Singapore govern ment’s share of total 
healthcare expenditure fell from 50 per cent in 19659 to 31 per cent in 2012. Even though these 
policies entailed a concomitant increase in the private cost of care, the government has , for most of 
the previous four decades,  enjoyed broad -based societal support, or at the very least acquiescence, 
for its healthcare financing policies. Academic Lim Meng Kin has a rgued  that Singaporeans 
demonstrate “ready acceptance for a social contract based on “individual responsibility” and  “co-
payment”” because of three unique features of Singapore’s politico -social context.  
 
First, Singapore has prospered in spite of great odds largely due to a strong government. As a result, 
the government has enjoyed enduring trust from the people as it  delivered on its promises. Second, 
Singapore has no tradition of state largesse or generous welfare benefits. The colonial health system, though free, was primarily targeted at the colonisers instead of the colonised. Local residents relied mostly on trad itional healers for healthcare. As a matter of fact, even though 
diseases and poverty were rampant in British Singapore, the first hospital, Tan Tock Seng hospital, was built using funds raised by Chinese community leaders (that is,  by self -help) and not t he state. 
Third, Singaporeans are pragmatic and understand that irrespective of whether the healthcare financing burden falls on taxes, Medisave, employer benefits or insurance, it is ultimately Singaporeans who  pay.
 10 
 Though there is no  strong  empirical support for the reasons posited by Lim, the 2002 World Values 
Survey  (WVS) confirms that a majority  of Singapore’s respondents (55 per cent ) thought that 
Singapore should be a society where taxes are low and individuals take responsibility of themselves. Only about 25 per cent  felt that the state should provide extensive social welfare and collect high 
taxes. Significantly, this finding lends credibility to assertions made by political leaders, such as the 
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, that Singaporeans would “not be willing to pay taxes that 
Scandinavians pay”.

The Subsidies + 3M System  
 
Singapore’s healthcare financing framework comprises government subsidies for health services 
obtained at public healthcare  institutions  and select private general practitioners’ clinics , a 
mandatory savings account (Medisave), a catastrophic medical insurance scheme (MediShield), and a means -tested financial assistance scheme (Medifund).
12 Together, they form what is commonly 
referred to as the “ subsidies + 3M ” framework .  
 1. Subsidies  
The government provides means -tested subsidies to citizens and Permanent Residents for inpatient 
services, day surgery, and specialist outpatient treatments received in government- owned 
restructured hospitals. These subsidies cover between  20 and 80 per cent  of the cost of treatment. 
Means -tested subsidies are also given for intermediate and long -term care  (ILTC) , while universal 
subsidies are provided to those who obtain general practitioner (GP) care at government -owned 
polyclinics. Private GPs provide the bulk of GP  care (about 80 per cent  of GPs in Singapore are in the 
private sector), but elderly citizens who pass a means test can apply for a Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS)  that allows them to re ceive subsidised care at private  GP clinics.
13  
 2. Medisave  
The primary aim of Medisave is to help individuals and their families save for their hospitalisation 
expenses, including those that will be incurred during retirement.  Employed individuals are required  
to make monthly  contributions, which increases with age, to their Medisave  accounts . To prevent 
over -consumpt ion of health care and the premature  depletion of Medisave, the Health Ministry s ets 
detailed rules concerning the permitted uses of Medis ave. Apart from individual  responsibility, 
Medisave also incorporates the principle of family responsibility. Patients can use the Medisave of immediate family members for healthcare financing. This enables income and risk - pooling at the 
household level.  
 
3. MediShield  
The primary aim of  MediShield  is to harness the power  of risk pooling  for medical catastrophes  or 
healthcare episodes for which it would neither be  efficient nor equitable to require individuals to 
save . It is thus explicitly designed to address medical episodes that are infrequent in nature, but 
impose high financial impacts  (i.e. low frequency, high impact events) . Although it is a national 
insurance scheme,  MediShield is quite unlike health  insurance s chemes in other developed countries 
for at least three  reasons.  
 
First, it is neither  mandatory nor universal. Though , at present, everyone is automatically enrolled in 
MediShield  by default , they can  choose to opt out. The elderly above 90 are excluded a nd those with 
severe pre- existing conditions cannot re -join MediShield once they have opted out. Second, 
MediShield is not an open -ended insurance that covers all medical treatments. Instead, it covers 
only catastrophic illnesses. Third, MediS hield  is designed based on market , instead of equity , 
principles. High -risk individuals, such as those with severe pre -existing conditions and the very old, 
                                                      
12 Another component of the healthcare financing framework is ElderShield, which was introduced in 2002. ElderShield 
provides basic financial protection to the elderly who need long -term care due to severe disabilities. At present, all CPF 
members who r each the age of 40 will be automatically enrolled in ElderShield. As the insurance is voluntary, members can 
opt out. They can, however, rejoin the scheme as long as they are below 65 and subject to a medical assessment. See 
Ministry of Health, “ElderShiel d,” updated 19 April 2013, 
<http://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/home/costs_and_financing/schemes_subsidies/ElderShield.html > (cited 30 
April  2013).

(cited 30 April 2013).    6 are excluded  in order to keep premiums low. The premiums also increase with age  to minimise 
cross -subsid isation across age groups ; in 2013, those aged 1 to 20 years old paid  $50 in annual 
premiums while thos e between 86 and 90 paid  $1,190.14 The MediS hield claim limits  – of $70,000 
for each year and $300,000 per policyholder15 – and the absence of ‘stop -loss’ measures  effectively 
transfers all the risk of catastrophic medical bills to patients and their families.  
 
4. Medifund 
While Medisave and Medishield were  designed very much with efficiency  considerations in mind , 
Medifund was designed to ensure  a certain degree  of social equity . If a patient  who  has received 
subsidised care cannot afford his bill even after using Medisave, MediS hield and seeking help from 
his family, he can apply for financial assistance from Medifund,  which serves  as a safety n et of last 
resort. Medifund is administered by the various public healthcare institutions.  
 
Since 2002, the subsidies + 3M system  has accounted  for between 31  and 39 per cent  of the total 
health spending (see Exhibit 4 ).16 Out-of-pocket payments by patients and other third -party insurers 
account for the remaining 60 per cent of the national health expenditure.

  Weaknesses of the  Healthcare Financing System  
 Scholars and commentators have evaluated Singapore’s healthcare financing system according to three criteria: efficiency, equity and adequacy.

16 Ministry of Health, “Healthcare financing sources”, updated 13 May 2013 < 
http://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/home/pressRoom/Parliamentary_QA/2013/healthcare -financing -
sources0.html > (cited 30 May 2013). Refer to Appendix A  for a detailed breakdown of the healthcare financing sources.    7 First,  Asher and Nandy argue that the financing system is inefficient because it has limited risk -
pooling features  such as mandatory health insurance or broad  government subsidies, which  are 
widely regarded as efficient as they  address adverse selection and other market fa ilures. 17 As 
previously discussed , MediS hield is not  an extensive risk -pooling arrangement when measured 
against the universal health insurance of other developed economies. This is because MediS hield 
operates very much like private insurance and is run  on commercial, rather than social, principles. As 
noted, to prevent cross -subsidisation, premiums are not pooled across age  groups . MediShield also 
excludes both  high -risk individuals (the elderly above 90 and those with severe pre- existing 
conditions ),18 and a wide range of health risks  from coverage.  While private insurers have  filled in  
the gap by providing insurance plans that cover  some of the health risks  currently  excluded from 
MediShield, these insurers stop short of providing affordable cove rage for high -risk individuals. 
These individuals are thus  forced to accumulate large savings to finance healthcare episodes that 
may or may not materialise , leading  to an inefficient and inequitable c urtailment of their 
consumption and well being . 
 
Second,  Abeysin ghe, Himani and Lim argue  that the reliance on personal and family responsibility 
and co -payments  means that the system is hig hly income dependent .19 This is not problematic if the 
healthcare financing system is progressive, that is, the  government  subsidies provided to lower and 
middle income Singaporeans are large enough to ensure that they spend a smaller fraction of their 
income on healthcare than richer individuals. There is admittedly little  hard  evidence that sheds light 
on the progressivity (or  lack thereof) of the financing system . Abeysinghe , Himani and Lim  speculate  
that if HDB 1 -3 rooms, 4 rooms, 5 rooms & executive, private flats and landed property owners 
sought treatment at Class C, B2, B2+, B1, A  wards  respectively, the financing system would be 
regressive.20  
 
A related concern is the extent to which the current healthcare financing system provides “ peace of 
mind”. A  2012 survey by Mindshare  revealed  that 72 per cent of respondents agreed with the 
statement “we cannot afford to get sick these days due to the high medical costs”.21 The staggering 
agreement raises question about whether healthcare remains affordable and accessible for the 
majority of Singaporeans. If  healthcare is affordable on average , further questions ought to  be raised  
about the reasons for the gap between the actual and perceived cost of healthcare.  
 A discussion about the equity of the financing system will not be complete without considering Medifund, the means -tested financial assistance scheme . Medifund’s stringent and opaque eligibility 
criteria have led some to challenge its efficacy in providing assurance to Singaporeans  facing  large 
medical bills. For example, Member of Parliament Lam Pin Min recounted the story of Marjorie Soh who was diagnosed with bone cancer in 2003 and raked up an estimated $400,000 in medical bills. Her bills were financed through the sale of her family’s flat, her family’s savings, bank loans and the good will of friends .

of 18,935 elderly patien ts who sought treatment at a tertiary public hospital in 2007. They linked dwelling types to the 
class of ward used by the patient to overcome the constraint of the absence of data that links income to patient 
expenditure.

representative, demonstrate that some Singaporeans, especially those who do not (or cannot)  
accumulate sizable savings, might  face significant financial distress when their family members 
experience a catastrophic health condition.  
 
Third, there are signs that the financing  system may be inad equate. Many Singaporeans do not meet 
the Medisave Minimum Sum , or the minimum amount of savings that they must accumulate in their 
Medisave when they turn 55  (see Exhibit 4 ). In addition, MediShield is not universal;  as at the end of 
2011, it cover ed 92 per cent  of the population and excluded  35 per cent  of elderly above 75.23 
Moreover, though  MediShield is ostensibly for protecting patients fro m catastrophic health 
expenses , Abeysinghe, Himani and Lim  find that MediShield  covered only 40 per cent  of the m ost 
expensive 10 per cent of medical episodes  faced by elderly seeking treatment in a particular public 
hospital in 2007 . 24 Separately, academics Asher and Nandy have  criticise d the exclusion of high -risk 
individuals from Medishield and its exclusion of many health risks from coverage.25 Medishield  also 
excludes those who cannot afford the premiums . Between  2006 and 2011, about 1 per cent  of 
MediShield policyholders saw their policies lapse  each year due to non -payment of premium caused 
by insufficient Medisave balances.26 Low-income  elder ly Singapor eans, who have to pay high 
premiums , may be especially vulnerable to such lapses of their and their family member’s  
MediShield policies.

Overlaying the weaknesses of the financing system are the changes to Singapore’s socio -political 
context.  Population ageing is producing a new set of policy and political challenges.  As the 
population ages, the national healthcare spending (both public and private) will increase since older persons  consume more healthcare than the young. The  risks associated with ageing, whether 
retirement adequacy or healthcare financing, are  mostly concen trated on the individual and the  
family. This financing arrangement accentuates the rising  income  inequality in Singapore because 
richer households are better pl aced  to absorb the risks faced by an ageing member than a middle  or 
low-income  household. The rich may also be able to afford significantly better care  for their elderly 
members. These diverg ent circumstances between the rich and the rest have the potential to offend 
Singaporeans’ sense of fairness , triggering a re -examination of a  welfare regime founded on 
personal and family responsibility.   
 Apart from sharpening the differences in the  quantity and quality of healthcare that rich and poo r 
(or middle income ) households can afford, income inequality can also reduce intergenerational 
social mobility. Economists studying Western economies have found a negative correlation between income inequality and intergenerational mobility –  that is the higher the income inequality in a 
society, the greater is the correlation between the incomes  of father s and their sons.
27 While there 
is no  evidence as  yet to suggest that social mobility has declined in Singapore over time, Prime 
Minister Lee Hsien Loong  remarked in 2011 that “[w]e are seeing our society stratifying, which 
means that children of successful people are doing better while the children of less successful people are doing less well … (MPs) see these in our daily lives, we watch out for it because we are shepherds and responsible for Singaporeans”.
28 If the Prime Minister’s diagnosis is correct, d eclining 
social mobility will inevitably reduce the ability of “less successful” households to share and pool 
risks, and to improve the life chances of the next generation.  This could well be another factor that 
could offend the sense of fairness among  Singaporeans and lead to calls for greater social protection  
and more vigorous fiscal redistribution .  
 Singaporeans are also concerned about the high cost  of living. The Institute of Policy Studies’ (IPS) 
Post -Election Survey 2011 revea led that 85 per cent of respondents felt that cost of living was 
important or very important in their voting decision s; this marked a 9 percentage point s increase 
from the 2006 Post -Election Survey .
29 As medical cost continue s to increase, it is likely to weigh on 
the minds of Singaporeans . The larger increase in healthcare costs relative to median and lower 
wage growth would also  lead to gaps in the abilit y of low and lower middle -income families to afford 
good healthcare over their lifetimes .30 This is because their modest wage gains limit their ability to 
accumulate sufficient savings to finance their own and their families’ healthcare expenditures. This 
problem is likely to worsen as the population ages. The confluence of rising healthcare costs, 
stagnating wages, rising income inequality and population aging is likely to increase the  demand for 
redistributio n, which might, in turn, lead  to incremental shifts away from personal and family 
responsibility.  
 Perhaps politics is the most vexatious of all the structural changes to Singapore’s operating context. 
The 2011 General Elections has resulted in a significant transformation of Singapore’s politics. There

30 Between 2009 and 2012, me dical inflation increased by 9% (Singstat, 2012).    10 is now greater political competition and lower popular support for the PAP as evidenced by the six -
percentage points decrease in popular votes for the PAP. The electorate, which used to trust the PAP 
government by default, today demands  greater voice, accountability and political representation. 
Admittedly, it is difficult to get a sense of what concerns the large majority of Singaporean where politics and policies are concerned. Are Singaporeans dissatisfied with the social compact and the 
healthcare financing system  that prioritises personal responsibility over social protection? Or are 
they unhappy only with the inadequacies of the policies that impinge on their daily -lived experience, 
such as public transport, housing, and immigration  policies? Perhaps, their disaffection is with the 
PAP government’s heavy -handed, non -consultative, government- knows -best style  of governing 
rather than its substantive policies? As the criticisms are often fragmented and diffused, it is difficult 
to disti l what citizens want, and their positions on the  level of social protection that the state should 
provide in healthcare, especially for the sick, old, poor and those who currently excluded from 
MediShield.   
 
 
Finding a Cure  
 
To recapitulate, the main deficiencies of the healthcare financing system are its poor coverage in 
terms of the types of people and the types of health risks that it covers. Healthcare  may be 
unaffordable, especially if patients face catastrophic medical b ills. The system also falls short in  
giving  Singaporeans “peace of mind”. The policy options available to the healthcare policy maker 
ranges from the incremental to the radical.  
 If policymakers choose an incremental approach, they might  pursue  the following to foster greater 
“peace of mind”:  
 
1. To address limited coverage , MediShield can include high -risk individuals at  actuarially fair 
premiums . MediShield could also insure against a greater variety of health risks at higher 
premiums. Alternativ ely, policymake rs can continue to exclude high -risk individuals from 
insurance coverage and instead increase efforts at assuring high risk individuals that 
financial assistance will be made available to them through Medifund should they face bills that the y cannot afford.  
 
2. To address concerns over affordability, the Government could increase tax -financed  
subsidies for healthcare  and therefore its share of national healthcare expenditure . It could 
also increase the variety of health risks covered by MediShield and raise the claim limits. The 
mean -testing criteria for Medifund can also be relaxed to make it  easier to qualify for 
financial assistance.  
 If policymakers choose a more radical approach, they  could consider the following : 
 
1. To address limited  coverage , they could m ake MediShield universal and compulsory so that 
everyone, regardless of age, health and economic status, is covered. To ensure that premiums are affordable, policymakers can rely on  more  extensive risk -pooling so that there 
is cross -subsidisation  between the rich and poor (as a result of premium subsidies given to 
the poor); young and old; and healthy and sick. Extensive risk -pooling will improve the 
equity of the healthcare financing system. MediShield could also insure against a gre ater 
variety of health risks.  
   11 2. To address concerns over affordability, policymakers could impose stop -loss limits that cap 
the financial risks patients face. The se limits  would  ensure that patients know upfront the 
financial risks that they will be exposed to should they face a particular health risk.

Abstract
There is growing evidence that political economy factors are central to whether or not proposed
health ﬁnancing reforms are adopted, but there is little consensus about which political and institu-
tional factors determine the fate of reform proposals. One set of scholars see the relative strengthof interest groups in favour of and opposed to reform as the determining factor. An alternative lit-
erature identiﬁes aspects of a country’s political institutions–speciﬁcally the number and strength
of formal ‘veto gates’ in the political decision-making process—as a key predictor of reform’s pros-pects. A third group of scholars highlight path dependence and ‘policy feedback’ effects, stressing
that the sequence in which health policies are implemented determines the set of feasible reform
paths, since successive policy regimes bring into existence patterns of public opinion and interestgroup mobilization which can lock in the status quo. We examine these theories in the context of
Malaysia, a successful health system which has experienced several instances of proposed, but ul-
timately blocked, health ﬁnancing reforms. We argue that policy feedback effects on public opinionwere the most important factor inhibiting changes to Malaysia’s health ﬁnancing system. Interest
group opposition was a closely related factor; this opposition was particularly powerful because
political leaders perceived that it had strong public support. Institutional veto gates, by contrast,played a minimal role in preventing health ﬁnancing reform in Malaysia. Malaysia’s dramatic early
success at achieving near-universal access to public sector healthcare at low cost created public
opinion resistant to any change which could threaten the status quo. We conclude by analysing theimplications of these dynamics for future attempts at health ﬁnancing reform in Malaysia.

Introduction
Why has comprehensive health financing reform failed to be
adopted in Malaysia, despite its frequent presence on the health pol-icy agenda, and despite support from the country’s politicalleadership since the mid-1980s? On a number of occasions over the
past 30 years, Malaysian policymakers have attempted to transformtheir existing hybrid system, in which tax-funded, publicly providedcare coexists with largely out-of-pocket financed private care, into a

 unified insurance-based system. On each occasion, the proposal was
defeated, despite the fact that a number of powerful groups andactors in Malaysian politics favoured health financing reform, andthe Malaysian political system has virtually no formal institutionalbarriers (veto gates) to policies advocated by the ruling coalition(Tsebelis, 2002 ).
Some analysts understand health system reform as a contest
among interest groups, in which reform will proceed if it gains thesupport of cohesive and mobilized politically powerful groups. Thiscannot explain the Malaysian case, since healthcare reform had sup-port from the most powerful institution in Malaysian politics at thetime, namely the then-ruling United Malays National Organization(UMNO) party, and its successive Prime Ministers (PMs). It alsohad support from other economically important groups such as pri-vate sector health providers and various large government-linkedcorporations (GLCs). It was opposed by weaker groups includingNGOs, academics, opposition parties and doctors’ professionalassociations. While interest group opposition to blocked financingreform has been part of the story in Malaysia, it does not appear tohave been decisive. Other influential work on the political economyof health reform identifies the number of veto gates in the policyprocess as a fundamental determinant of the success or failure ofhealth reform ( Immergut, 1992 ;Steinmo and Watts, 1995 ;Sparkes
et al. , 2015 ). In contrast, we show that this cannot explain the fail-
ure of comprehensive healthcare reforms in Malaysia since there areessentially no formal veto gates in its political system that restrainelected majorities from passing their preferred legislation.
Stakeholder interviews for this project highlighted a different fac-
tor: political leaders’ perception of public opinion was a major barrierto reform, specifically because of the sequence in which health cover-
age had been rolled out ( Fox and Reich, 2015 ). Interviewees stressed
that while interest group opposition was an important factor, the fun-damental constraint on reform was public support for the existingsystem of health finance. Interviewees argued that because theMalaysian public already enjoyed near-universal access to publiclyprovided healthcare at modest cost, Malaysians viewed reformattempts primarily as a threat. This feeling was perceived to be broad-ly shared among the population but was perhaps most salient for thegroup at the heart of the then-ruling party’s electoral coalition, therural ethnic Malay population. Thus while the government had longwanted to transform the health finance system, and had the electoralmajorities necessary to do so, it stepped back from doing so each timein the face of citizen group mobilization and hostile public opinion.This is what Pierson (1993) describes as a ‘policy feedback’ effect,
since this public opinion was perceived to result from Malaysia’searlier health policy achievements, most notably the provision of
healthcare access to the public at very low out-of-pocket cost, includ-ing to the rural poor. While health policymakers worried about thesustainability of this system, they did not manage to convince thepublic at large that reforms would preserve low cost, progressivelyfinanced access to healthcare, and political leaders were therefore un-willing to move forward with reforms. The situation in Malaysiashows strong resemblance to the politics of welfare state retrenchmentin the USA and Europe, which Pierson (1996) argues is characterized
by strong public support for and interest group mobilization behindthe healthcare status quo, loss aversion as the public contemplates re-form, and general inertia in political institutions.
The reasons why Malaysia did not adopt health financing
reforms which would transition the country toward a social healthinsurance (SHI) system are of broader interest, since there has beenglobal momentum in developing countries away from governmentfinancing and provision and towards SHI systems (Wagstaff, 2010).Malaysia’s resistance to these reform proposals can shed light on thepolitical economy dynamics of similar reforms in other settings.
Methods
In order to understand the views of health system participants onthe politics of Malaysia’s health reform efforts, we conducted an in-depth stakeholder analysis using semi-structured interviews with>40 stakeholders with interest in or influence over health system re-
form ( Reich, 1996 ). We defined stakeholders as ‘actors who have an
interest in the issue under consideration, who are affected by theissue, or who—because of their position—have or could have an ac-tive or passive influence on the decision making and implementationprocesses’ ( Brugha and Varvasovszky, 2000 ). We developed a pre-
liminary list of potential stakeholders, and refined it in consultationwith counterparts in the Ministry of Health (MOH) and academia.These stakeholders included current and former officials at key gov-ernment ministries as well as healthcare providers (public and pri-vate sector physicians and hospital managers), educational andaccreditation bodies, NGOs, international organizations, businessleaders and researchers. We then analysed the interview transcriptsand other primary source documents to identify each stakeholder’srelative power, position on both past and proposed future healthreforms, the intensity of their commitment and their degree of mo-bilization around health reform ( Roberts et al., 2008 ).
Second, in addition to this primary data collection via interviews,
we analysed the secondary literature on Malaysia’s health reform
efforts. Third, we analysed the comparative politics literature on theKey Messages
•This study examined efforts at health ﬁnancing reform in Malaysia over 35 years, seeking to identify why health ﬁnanc-
ing reforms were continuously proposed by the government but consistently blocked by opponents.
•Data were gathered through more than 40 interviews with health sector stakeholders in Malaysia, as well as otherinformants knowledgeable about policy and political dynamics.
•We examined the relative explanatory power of theories of interest group competition, veto points and historical institu-tionalism/path dependency.
•We found that the historical institutionalist approach best explains Malaysia’s persistently blocked reforms, while inter-est groups mobilization played an important secondary role. There was a clear path dependency to the process: previ-ous expansions of subsidized health services had created public opinion very resistant to ﬁnancing changes.
•Stakeholders argue that Malaysian policymakers observed public backlash to reform proposals, feared political conse-quences and thus refrained from implementing their preferred reforms.Health Policy and Planning , 2019, Vol. 34, No. 10 733Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/heapol/article/34/10/732/5575920 by Singapore Institute of Management user on 19 February 2024
 Malaysian state and Malaysia’s political economy. Finally, we
assessed the extent to which the mechanisms and processes identi-fied by interviewees and in the secondary literature were consistentwith theories of interest group competition, veto gates or path de-pendency, and the relative contribution of each of these theories.
Theoretical framework
There is no single generally accepted theory which is universallyused to explain variation in health system reform outcomes, but ra-
ther a set of theories, which span several academic disciplines
(Roberts et al., 2008 ). Accordingly, this analysis examines the extent
to which several of the most prominent of these theoretical frame-works can explain the success or failure of health financing reformin Malaysia: interest group theory, veto gates theory and historicalinstitutionalist theory, with a focus on mechanisms of pathdependency.
Interest group-centred theory focuses on the ability of powerful
groups (such as business interests, economic elites or medical pro-viders) to block health reforms which go against their interests.Healthcare reforms create winners and losers, which can result in in-tense mobilization and lobbying for or against reform proposals bygroups in society ( Kauffman and Nelson, 2004 ). According to theo-
ries of interest group competition, policymaking is a contest amongvarious interested parties, with reforms most likely to progress if thecoalition of groups mobilized in favour of change is stronger andmore unified than the coalition blocking reform, and vice-versa.Roberts et al. (2008 , pp. 70–71) highlight the importance of analy-
sing the relative power, position and level of mobilization of interestgroups outside of government, as well as ministries and actors insidethe government.
A second set of theories on the determinants of healthcare reform
relate to the institutional features of a country’s political system,namely the number of veto gates ( Immergut, 1992 ;Tsebelis, 2002 ).
Any person or group with the power to block policy change can beunderstood as a veto gate, which means that in political systems withmany veto gates, many actors have a legal ability to block or seriouslyimpede major reforms proposed by the executive, including minorityparties in the legislature, courts and state governments. (For example,the proliferation of veto gates in US political institutions is often usedto explain the repeated failure of legislation to ensure universal healthcoverage; see Steinmo and Watts, 1995 .) In systems with fewer veto
gates (such as Great Britain), parliamentary majorities face few insti-
tutional impediments to passing legislation.
Finally, we draw on the historical institutionalist tradition in polit-
ical science, particularly the concepts of path dependency and policyfeedback. Path dependency in this context refers to the idea that theset of feasible policy options at any point in time is shaped by the pol-icy choices of the past, including the institutional arrangements andconfigurations of public opinion generated by these past choices(Pierson, 1996 ). As in interest group theory, the relative power of
institutions and interest groups matters, but historical institutionalisttheories stress that interest groups do not emerge organically from so-ciety. Rather, the ways in which various groups are mobilized to pro-mote or defend certain policy options, and the views of the publicabout these options, are often a function of the policies that havebeen previously enacted. Pierson (1993) describes as ‘policy feedback’
the idea that policies create public opinion, which then constrains fu-ture policies. Successful policies mobilize interest groups and shapepublic opinion in their own defense, and can imbue systems with adegree of stability that might not be predicted simply by assessing the
relative power of groups more broadly, or the legal hurdles to reform.
Major health system reform initiatives in Malaysia
The central thrust of health policy in Malaysia from independence in1957 through the early 1980s was the expansion of essential healthservices to the entire population, particularly the rural poor. Malaysiawas very successful at this task, achieving broad access to primaryhealthcare, and rapid reductions of under-5 and maternal mortality(Pathmanathan et al.,2 0 0 3 ), at relatively modest cost, and while pro-
viding substantial financial protection, especially for the poor
(Rannan-Eliya et al. ,2 0 1 6 ). Initial impetus towards health financing
reform in Malaysia came about in 1983, when PM MahathirMohamad announced a new economic direction for Malaysia basedon a renewed focus on private sector growth. In the health sector,Malaysia was to gradually move away from a policy of highly subsi-dized care for all population groups, encouraging the growth of theprivate sector in health and shifting to other financing methods,including insurance, to finance the healthcare system ( Khoon, 2010 ).
In 1985, the government commissioned the first of a number of stud-ies proposing the transition to an insurance-based system. In line withthis vision, and encouraged by senior Malaysian policymakers, theprivate health sector grew rapidly—the number of private hospitalsquadrupled from 1980 to 2000, from 50 to 224 ( Chee and
Barraclough, 2007 ), and the private, out-of-pocket share of national
health expenditure grew steadily. In the 1990s, there were a series ofincremental reforms in this direction, such as the corporatization ofHospital Kuala Lumpur’s cardiac unit into the National HeartInstitute in 1992, followed by contracting out Malaysia’s drug distri-bution system to private companies in 1994, and in 1996, outsourcingof hospital support services to private suppliers. Despite these incre-mental changes, the Mahathir-led government refrained from enforc-ing fundamental systemic restructuring of the health financingsystem. Nevertheless, this vision of reform continued to be proposedin a series of government-commissioned analyses of the health systemthroughout the 1980s and 1990s ( Juni, 2014 ).
As a result, comprehensive financing reform remained on the
agenda. In 1999, the government’s declaration of its intent to cor-poratize public hospitals, to enable them to function along commer-cial lines, was a key tipping point in the politics of reform. A vocaland well-organized opposition to this reform emerged: the Citizen’sHealth Initiative coalition, organized by non-governmental actorsand activists and academics from the Malaysia Medical Association,University Sains Malaysia and the Consumer Association of Penang
(Leng and Hong, 2015 ). With elections approaching, the govern-
ment backed off of its corporatization proposal, and even increasedfunding for public hospitals ( Kuhonta, 2011 ).
After this setback, comprehensive healthcare reforms stayed off
the Barisan National-led government’s agenda until the late 2000s,when the MOH began to develop the ‘1Care’ plan. This plan out-lined major transformation in the healthcare financing system, againstressing the introduction of an insurance-based model. ‘1Care’ended up being ‘arguably ...the most contentious issue in health in
Malaysian society spanning three decades’ ( Leng and Hong, 2015 ).
The substance and rationale for the reform appears to have shiftedfrom a focus on the need to limit public spending on health(Barraclough, 2000 ), which was central to PM Mahathir’s justifica-
tion for earlier reform proposals, to a desire to pool public and pri-vate health spending and thus improve the efficiency of healthspending. Yet the 1Care proposals still broadly reflected a shift to aninsurance-based system, and inspired opposition from a coalition734 Health Policy and Planning , 2019, Vol. 34, No. 10Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/heapol/article/34/10/732/5575920 by Singapore Institute of Management user on 19 February 2024
 similar to the one that opposed the earlier corporatization effort. An
early draft of the plan was leaked to the media by opponents, and asocial media campaign against the plan ensued. Between Februaryand June 2012, the ‘TakNak 1Care’ (‘Do not want 1Care’) move-ment emerged, with a highly visible online presence to mobilize op-position to the plan. Again eager to avoid vocal opposition beforethe impending 2013 national elections, the government once againshelved its plans to transform the health financing system.
Thus, the basic pattern of healthcare reforms in Malaysia from
the early 1980s until the present day is that Malaysia’s powerful pol-itical leadership favoured dramatic healthcare financing and deliveryreforms, yet each attempt was comprehensively blocked by civil so-ciety mobilization—which the government believe had strong rootsin public opinion—and systematic reforms were never fully imple-mented. In the following sections, we consider competing explana-tions for this.
Results: stakeholder analysis
We conducted a stakeholder analysis analysing the positions, inter-ests, power and influence of relevant actors within the Malaysiansystem and their positions on health system reform. Our sample
included representatives from the Malaysian government, quasi-
governmental corporations, professional and accreditation associa-tions, political parties, civil society (NGOs, academia, think-tanks),as well as public and private healthcare providers in Malaysia. Weanalyse their positions on key past reform attempts, the reason forthese positions and the degree to which their opposition was per-ceived as decisive in preventing the implementation of these reforms.
Supporters of reform
Our interviews highlighted three groups that supported health systemreform in Malaysia during key episodes of attempted reform from themid-1980s to the current day: senior policymakers in UMNO andtechnocrats in key policy planning agencies such as the EconomicPlanning Unit (EPU), senior leaders in the MOH, and large privatesector and quasi-government corporate entities either active in thehealth sector or interested in investing in the sector. High-level polit-ical support in the early 1980s originated with the political leadershipof the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition, led by the UMNO party,principally the PM’s Office, and the technocrats in the EPU. Themotivation of these state actors came from various sources. PMMahathir was motivated by an ideological and policy vision for areduced state role in healthcare financing and delivery, a larger pri-vate role and an eventual transition to a partially privatized,insurance-based system. Other political actors may have been morefocused on SHI benefits for specific constituencies, such as Malaysia’slarge and politically important civil service. In the MOH, intervieweesnoted persistent internal divisions about the precise form of reform,with some stakeholders believing that problems could be solved withincreases in the budget, rather than comprehensive reform. Otherstakeholders noted that while the policy side of the ministry was in fa-vour of financing reform, the administrative side (which would beheavily involved in implementing new payment models) was muchless enthusiastic. Nonetheless, the MOH has always been at least for-mally in favour of government reform, and was clearly a centraldriver of the 1Care reform proposal. Finally, private and corporateinterests including private hospitals and GLCs generally supportedreforms since it promised them a larger share of the public sectordominated healthcare market. (GLCs are for-profit companies direct-ly or indirectly under Malaysian government control, and are largestakeholders in commercial private healthcare, owning 40% of pri-
vate hospital beds in Malaysia.)
Opponents of reform
The main groups against reform were civil society actors (consumergroups and trade unions), medical provider associations and oppos-ition parties. While UMNO dominated Malaysian politics through-out the period in question and opposition parties had never heldpower, these opposition parties played important roles in health re-form debates. They all opposed the reforms of the late 1990s such asthe proposal to corporatize all public hospitals in Malaysia; whenthe main opposition parties united to form the ‘Barisan Alternatif’coalition before the 1999 General Election, their manifesto commit-ting to ‘abolish all programs to privatize the public health system’(Barisan Alternatif, 1999 ). They have remained opposed to the gov-
ernment’s proposals for health system reform: during the 2013General Election, the main opposition parties released a commonmanifesto once again declaring that they ‘reject all attempts to intro-duce a healthcare tax such as 1Care; Ensure free healthcare for allMalaysians through government hospitals while incentivizing theprivate sector to provide healthcare services at a reasonable rate’(Opposition Joint Platform, 2013 ).
Civil society groups, such as NGOs, trade unions and consumer
groups, have similarly opposed the government’s health system re-form proposals. The important role played by this sector is in itselfan anomaly, given that civil society has been relatively weak inMalaysia compared to other countries at its level of development,
due to a legacy of state policies which constrained the space for inde-
pendent civil society organizations ( Pepinsky, 2009 ). Unions, con-
sumer groups and health provider groups rallied together to formthe Citizen’s Health Initiative in 1997, and a similar set of groupsformed the Coalition Against the Privatization of Health Services(CAPHS) in 2005.
A third group of reform opponents were private sector doctors,
who comprise approximately half of all doctors in Malaysia. Thekey national bodies representing doctors and hospitals in the privatesector include the Malaysian Medical Association (MMA), with/C248000 members of the total 49 000 doctors in the country, the
Federation of Private Medical Practitioners Associations, Malaysia(FPMPAM) with 5000 members, and the Association of PrivateHospitals Malaysia (APHM). Among clinicians, the largest andmost influential in health financing reform debates are the estimated7000 private general practitioners (GPs) in Malaysia, who functionas either group practices or as solo independent clinics.
While civil society and NGOs were more prominent in privatiza-
tion debates in the 1990s ( Barraclough, 1999 ), opposition from pri-
vate GPs was critical in thwarting the implementation of the 1Carereform. Stakeholders identified specialist clinics in particular asvehement opponents of 1Care, since they would likely lose patientsand revenues under a system that incorporated a family medicine‘gatekeeper’ who would only refer to patients to them who couldnot be treated by a GP (Interview no. 9, 2015; Leng and Hong,
2015 ). Conversely, interviewees argued that non-specialist GPs who
had fewer patients (and lower revenues) would be potentially opento a capitation-based system that would increase their patient num-bers, with their support or opposition depending critically on thecapitation rates to be agreed with the government (Interview no. 3,2015).
Interest group opposition in itself is a common feature of health
reform. But its success in Malaysia is notable, given that, first, inother sectors, the Malaysian state is distinctive for its ability to carryHealth Policy and Planning , 2019, Vol. 34, No. 10 735Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/heapol/article/34/10/732/5575920 by Singapore Institute of Management user on 19 February 2024
 out difficult policies in the face of organized opposition from social
groups. Slater (2010) e.g. notes that the Malaysia has ‘one of the
strongest ...state apparatuses in the developing world’ from an early
stage ‘noteworthy for the effectiveness of its coercive and adminis-trative institutions’ and highlights that, in contrast to so many devel-oping countries, it has had relatively little trouble extractingtaxation from economic elites. Second, in many health reform epi-sodes, health providers are the central interest group. At severalinstances in the health reform debates in Malaysia, providers werepartially divided about reforms. The fact that the government clearlychose to step back from conflict on a number of occasions despite itsstrength vis-a-vis civil society, and despite divisions in the oppos-ition, suggests something significant about the underlying politics ofhealth reform, which we discuss further below.
Veto gates analysis
We now turn to ‘veto gates’ theory for an alternative explanationfor the failure of healthcare reform in Malaysia. Veto gates theorycontends that the number of decision-making points or ‘veto gates’
through which a policy must pass are potential hurdles that can
waylay or block the passage of government policies and programs(Tsebelis, 2002 ). A classic example is the USA, where despite opin-
ion polls showing majorities of the public supporting expansion ofhealth coverage, legislation towards this goal was blocked overmore than 50 years because of the large number of ‘veto points’ inthe American system: two houses of Congress (one of which hasrules which require a supermajority to pass most legislation), a judi-ciary with the power to strike down legislation, and a federal systemwith a pivotal role for states in decision-making and policy imple-mentation. Closer to Malaysia, Selway (2011) argues that the frag-
menting effect of the Thai electoral rules prior to the 1997constitutional reform prevented health reform in Thailand.
However, this theory is problematic in Malaysia’s case, since it
has unusually few veto gates. In Malaysia’s Westminster-style parlia-mentary system, a large degree of power is delegated to the PM by themajority party or coalition. As long as the PM retains the support ofhis party, there are few formal checks on his policymaking power.Internally, the PM’s position over the period in question was furtherstrengthened by the ruling party’s centralization and strong internaldiscipline ( Brownlee, 2007 ;Levitsky and Way, 2010 ;Slater, 2010 ).
MacIntyre (2001) notes that during this period, ‘With the cabinet
overwhelmingly dominated by UMNO, for most purposes the effect-ive locus of veto power is within the UMNO leadership. If UMNOleaders favour a policy change, it easily obtains cabinet approval andpasses quickly into law since there are no other veto players to bereckoned with.’ If the PM and the Cabinet decide to make a policychange (such as health reform), they have an automatic parliamentarymajority. Therefore, ‘veto gates’ theory does not explain the govern-ment’s persistent failure to pass healthcare reform.
Historical institutionalist analysis
The final set of theories that we bring to bear on understanding thefailure of healthcare reforms in Malaysia are historical institutional-ist approaches. Historical institutionalist scholars view existing insti-tutions—political and legal structures, formal and informal rules,laws and regulations—as the results of a series of political strugglesbetween groups, emphasizing the contingent and historically deter-mined nature of the process by which some social groups are mobi-lized into such issue conflicts while others remain latent ordemobilized. Historical institutionalists also emphasize that politicalinstitutions are ‘sticky’ and difficult to change, so that the initial
form of institutions strongly influences policy choices long into thefuture ( Pierson, 2004 ). Applied to health policy, historical institu-
tionalist approaches emphasize (1) the important of initial condi-tions when key institutions were created, which shape the initialform that institutions take; (2) the sequencing of health reforms; and(3) the alignment of large social and political groupings around pol-icy issues, which is in turn shaped by the initial conditions and thesequencing of reforms ( Hacker, 1998 ).
In Malaysia’s case, the issue of reform sequencing emerged as a
critical explanation for the persistent failure of reform efforts. Anumber of stakeholders noted that the reason why the governmentfeared pushing through these reforms was that they believed that theMalaysian public was deeply accustomed to low-cost services paidfor out of general taxation, and would resist heavily any new systemthat required premiums and higher co-pays. Specifically, the pointrepeatedly raised was that it would be hard to make these changes,given how accustomed Malaysians were to current system.
Several interviewees noted the highly salient fact that patients pay
just 5 ringgit ( /C24$1) for doctor’s visits as a symbolic element of the
existing healthcare system that voters were extremely attached to:
Since independence, people have been given free care, subsidized
to a level of $1. Now, I am just trying to say: Can we top it up to
$5?...There is hue and cry from the public, and politicians who
are following say no, why should we tax the public? So they
know they are going to lose, politically the government will godown, because the opposition will attack. It is not going to hap-
pen.Interview no. 27 (2015)
One Ministry official stressed the same idea, noting that even mild
increases in user fees at various points were seen as untenable forpolitical reasons.
There a lot of people who are misusing emergency department ...
The emergency department is free. We say, we charge them 5
Ringgit. They say cannot! Politically unacceptable! Now you’re
talking about, 2 Ringgit or 5 Ringgit is politically unacceptable,
and now you’re going to talk about ...health care financing, and
transforming the healthcare system? How can it be acceptable?So I feel that sometimes ...people who are making policies are
not realistic. They want something, and yet they so scared of a
small thing. Interview no. 1 (2015)
Another noted:
They [the public] will be very, very upset. In this country, any-
thing other than free service will be upsetting. Because they are
so used to not paying for health care. Even vitamins, supplementsthey want government to pay for them. So, somewhere along the
line, you need a bold government ...So I don’t think it’s going to
happen any time now ...If the government is weak, when you do
this, it will be political suicide. But if they want to do health care
financing, it may be political suicide ...They do not know how
to tell the rakyat [public]: Please pay for healthcare.
This public opinion dynamic is also related to the politics of the rul-
ing party, in a way that points back to the circumstances at the cre-ation of the modern Malaysian healthcare system shortly afterindependence. UMNO first emerged politically to defend the pos-ition of the ethnic Malay community in the years immediately priorto independence, and throughout its history, UMNO has delivered awide range of benefits to the ethnic Malay community in exchangefor their political support ( Pepinsky, 2009 ;Slater, 2010 ). Health is
an important component of this relationship ( Barraclough, 2000 ;
Chee, 2008 ), and this political imperative to deliver services to the736 Health Policy and Planning , 2019, Vol. 34, No. 10Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/heapol/article/34/10/732/5575920 by Singapore Institute of Management user on 19 February 2024
 rural Malay population can help explain the political logic of
Malaysia’s historic achievements in achieving broad access tohealthcare. Given this political dynamic, UMNO leaders were un-willing to take steps that made it seem to their voters as if they werereducing their access to highly subsidized health services. They feltthat, given the reliance of the ruling coalition on the votes of ruralMalays who are the largest beneficiaries of the existing system, anychange would be, in an interviewee’s words, ‘political suicide’.
This has been noted in the secondary literature—reflecting on
the failure of the corporatization reform in 2000, Barraclough noted‘Any radical change to the role of the state as provider of publichealthcare poses problems of political legitimacy for a ruling coali-tion which has historically projected itself as delivering socioeco-nomic benefits to the population and especially to its principalconstituency, the rural Malays’ ( Barraclough, 2000 ).
It was also noted in stakeholder interviews:
Who are the main users of the public healthcare service? Public
servants, mostly from the Malays, and those who are ...from the
rural area, who are also mostly Malay: they use this system. Andthey are being made to understand by the political rulers, that, in
a way, we are giving it to you ...So these are the group which
will oppose very much, if the social health insurance people come
in. It will be political suicide for the government if it comes in,
because how are they going to talk to this group of people whohad been receiving healthcare, especially in rural area throughout
all these years, at the most negligible fees? Interview no. 3 (2015)
Others highlighted the extent to which the current Barisan Nasional
coalition relies on smaller rural-based parties (such as from Sabahand Sarawak) and the votes of rural UMNO voters (in part becauseof gerrymandered parliamentary constituencies) who are perceivedas more like to favour the status quo and therefore resist anychanges to current benefits:
I don’t think, under the current circumstances, where the polit-
ical domination isn’t as strong as it was before, it’s that easy to
reach that consensus. Especially [now], when you see the coali-
tion where the party that represents more rural areas is getting
stronger. So you can see the demand of the rural [population]
where everything is being provided by the government is the keywords. I don’t think you want to touch reform ...Good luck to
the politician [who tries that].
These public opinion dynamics, working in conjunction with inter-
est group opposition, were in our analysis the fundamental con-straint to the implementation of health financing reform.
Discussion and conclusion
In this article, we examine the case of a health financing reform thatnever happened, in Malaysia. In doing so, we find that the theoriesof historical institutionalism, and its emphasis on path dependencythrough the mechanism of policy feedback, best explain the failureto implement comprehensive healthcare financing and delivery re-form. In this section, we consider the Malaysian case in comparativeperspective, and then consider the implications of this finding for fu-ture reform efforts.
International comparisons
A natural point of comparison for Malaysia’s health reform is otherrecent reforms in middle-income countries. A common pattern isdiscernible in many such countries: typically the poor were relativelydisadvantaged by an inequitable, two-tiered system, in which publicexpenditure favoured the relatively better off. For example in manyLatin American cases, spending per capita was much higher in paral-
lel social security systems which served civil servants and the formalsector labour force, while the rural poor and informal sector work-ers relied on the underfunded public sector ( Kauffman and Nelson,
2004 ). In these contexts, comprehensive reform towards a more uni-
versal and equitable insurance-based system was very difficult topass, because of interest group opposition, but it was often political-ly popular ( Harris, 2015 ). A key challenge in such cases was not
winning over public opinion, but defeating interest group coalitionsrepresenting the relative elite groups (civil servants, urban middleclass, some groups of medical providers) that benefited from theexisting system. In a number of cases, democratizing reforms werekey turning point which broke the political stalemate and triggeredmajor health system reforms ( Wong, 2004 ;Selway, 2011 ;Gomez-
Dantes et al., 2015 ).
However, applying this model of health reform to Malaysia is
misleading because the starting point in Malaysia was roughly theopposite of this. Existing health spending was unusually progressive,in contrast to the fragmented and regressive systems common toother pre-reform health systems. The challenge was not defeatinginterest groups opposed to reform, but rather to reassure the publicthat a new system will maintain the universality and progressivityof the existing Malaysian system. In this regard, a more relevantcomparator for Malaysia may be the group of health systems, likeHong Kong and Sri Lanka, which achieved early universal access togovernment-financed and -provided healthcare in parallel with out-of-pocket financed private sectors that accommodate wealthier con-sumers ( Rannan-Eliya et al. , 2016 ). The experience of Hong Kong
in particular provides close parallels: like Malaysia, Hong Kong has
had a long history of attempted comprehensive health finance re-form to shift to a unified national insurance-based system ( Gauld,
2007 ), supported by successive governments, which were similarly
unconstrained by formal institutions checks (or veto gates) on deci-sion making. But comprehensive financing reform in Hong Kongwas blocked by a number of factors, including wariness from thepublic, who were attached to the existing health financing system(Luk, 2014 ).
Implications for future reform efforts
The political dynamics of all reform efforts in Malaysia must be
reassessed following the historic defeat in 2018 of the Barisan
Nasional coalition and the election of former PM Mahathir
Mohamed as leader of the opposition Pakatan Harapan coalition.
However, an implication of our findings which apply to any futurereform efforts is that an important obstacle will continue to be pub-lic opinion. Given the Malaysian system’s remarkable achievementsin access and financial protection, the public’s uncertainty in theface of dramatic change can be seen as rational. Reform proposalswill be more popular, and therefore more feasible, if policymakerscan identify policy options which are clearly understood by the pub-lic as preserving these attributes. It is not enough to simply craftgood policy; it must also be understood by the public as such.
However, creating a popular reform highlights important trade-
offs. As Rannan-Eliya et al. (2013) have shown, the current health
financing system in Malaysia is extremely progressive, since thehighest income groups pay a large portion of taxes, but often opt forprivate sector healthcare options for themselves. Given this baseline,citizens do not seem irrational to worry that, depending on thedetails, reforms could shift the situation in a more regressive direc-tion. It is also possible to design a comprehensive reform that shiftsMalaysia to an insurance-based system which would give allHealth Policy and Planning , 2019, Vol. 34, No. 10 737Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/heapol/article/34/10/732/5575920 by Singapore Institute of Management user on 19 February 2024
 Malaysians access to public and private facilities, while maintaining
or increasing progressivity, by making insurance premiums progres-sive and exempting the poor. But as Rannan-Eliya et al. (2013) note,
this would likely involve higher levels of public spending. This maybe an unwelcome trade-off to policymakers who had originally seenmoving to an insurance-based system as a way to reduce growth inpublic expenditures on health. But the politics of reform may makeit inevitable.
Finally, our interviews highlighted serious concerns regarding
the process by which previous reform policies have been designed,specifically the extent to which the reform process was open and in-clusive, and the extent to which broad groups of stakeholders wereconsulted and taken into account ( Juni, 2014 ; Interview no. 7,
2015; Interview no. 16, 2015; Interview no. 38, 2015). A number ofinterviewees referred to the secretive process by which previousreforms had been developed as a key obstacle to generating broaderbuy-in, especially from key stakeholders such as medical professio-nals. Such a process would help not just with interest groups butalso with public opinion. Political scientists have shown that in othersettings, the public cannot easily make judgments about the contentof complicated policy issues about which even specialists disagree.Rather, voters rely on cues from trusted stakeholders in the systemabout whether a given policy (such as a health reform proposal) islikely to be in their interests or not ( Achen and Bartels, 2016 ).
Crafting an inclusive process that generated input and buy in fromprevious reform opponents such as NGOs and medical professionalswould be difficult, but could signal a broad social consensus on theneed for reform, and would thereby reduce the likelihood of the
public disapproval which was fatal to previous reform efforts.
