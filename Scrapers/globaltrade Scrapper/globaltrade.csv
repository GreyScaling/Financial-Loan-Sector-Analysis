B2C Ecommerce in Malaysia Supported by Developed Logistics and Internet Infrastructure,"A new report by yStats.com, a market research company based in Hamburg, Germany, finds that business-to-consumer (B2C) ecommerce in Malaysia is expected to maintain rapid growth, supported by a relatively developed logistics infrastructure and substantial internet penetration rates by regional standards. Malaysia ranked second in Southeast Asia in internet penetration and had the highest logistics performance index in its region and income group in 2014. With the infrastructure being relatively advanced, B2C ecommerce in Malaysia has a potential to grow rapidly at double-digit rates over the next five years. The online share of total retail sales is projected to increase more than five-fold over the same period from just over one percent in 2013. An important characteristic of the Malaysian B2C E-Commerce market is that convenience is the key motivation for consumers to shop online. The main discouraging factor is lack of interest in online shopping, holding back the majority of over three-quarters of internet users who do not yet make purchases online. Another interesting fact is that food and beverage was the second most popular product category in online shopping in Malaysia, purchased almost as much as clothing. A healthy double digit share of online purchases in Malaysia was reported to come from cross-border sales last year. Global ecommerce websites Aliexpress.com,  Alibaba.com and Amazon.com are among the top 10 most visited online shopping websites in Malaysia. The leading local and regional players include online classifieds website Mudah.my and online retailer and marketplace Lazada.com.my. A newcomer is the ecommerce marketplace 11Street.my, launched by Korean companies SK Planet, and Celcom Axiata Berhad, which in a matter of a few months became one of the most visited online shopping websites in the country.

Australia’s Toll Group to Build Logistics Hub in Singapore,"Toll Group recently unveiled its blueprint for Toll City, a logistics hub in Tuas, Singapore, of over one million square feet. The $167 million, five-level, facility will house state-of-the-art automation systems to improve productivity and operating efficiency for Toll and its customers in Singapore and in the region. The Australia-based Toll Group, a division of Japan Post, is a provider of transportation and logistics in the Asia-Pacific region. The development is a key part of Toll’s strategy to strengthen its presence in the region and to continue providing best-in-class supply chain solutions across different market sectors, according to Toll CEO Chris Pearce. “The size and scope of this investment is a testament to Toll’s intent to achieve supply chain excellence in Asia Pacific for its customers,” Pearce said. “Toll City will redefine warehousing solution options for its customers through leading-edge technology and innovation in a world class facility. We will be ready to increase Toll’s productivity and meet warehousing capacity demand in a region that is set to become one of the largest economic blocs in the world.” Some of the high-tech options being reviewed for the Toll City development include high-speed unit picking, voice picking, and intelligent conveyor systems. The integrated transport and warehouse systems are complemented by energy-efficient initiatives including rain water harvesting and energy monitoring. “The success of Singapore as a world-leading logistics hub stems from the close collaborations with key industry players, such as Toll Group,” said Kelvin Wong, assistant managing director of the Singapore Economic Development Board. “Toll City demonstrates Singapore’s position as a strategic base for regional supply chain operations, as well as Toll Group’s commitment to set new benchmarks for Singapore’s logistics industry by creating solutions that drive productivity growth.” Pearce said that the completion of Toll City in mid-2017will enhance Singapore’s position as a regional logistics hub and provide Toll’s customers access to greater flexibility and scalability in their supply chains. Toll City’s proximity to road links to Malaysia and the growing Jurong region makes the facility an excellent land-sea interface for its customers. It also coincides with the planned 2020 completion of the Tuas Port which will consolidate all of Singapore’s container operations in one terminal and handle up to 65 million TEUs per year when fully operational.
