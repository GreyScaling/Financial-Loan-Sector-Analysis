Singapore, 29 January 2019 – Ascott Residence Trust’s (Ascott Reit) distribution per unit (DPU) increased 5% year-on-year to 2.15 cents in 4Q 2018. Unitholders’ distribution for FY 2018 is a record high at S$154.8 million, a 2% increase from FY 2017. This was on the back of 4Q 2018 Unitholders’ distribution rising 6% to S$46.5 million over 4Q 2017.
Gross profit for 4Q 2018 increased 3% to S$63.4 million due to higher revenue. Revenue grew 2% to S$136.5 million. This was mainly contributed by the additional revenue of S$0.4 million from Ascott Orchard Singapore acquired in October 2017 and higher revenue of S$2.7 million from existing properties, partially offset by the decrease in revenue of S$1.1 million from divestments1. On a same-store basis, gross profit and revenue also increased. Ascott Reit’s revenue per available unit (RevPAU) for 4Q 2018 increased 5% year-on-year to S$163.
Mr Bob Tan, Ascott Residence Trust Management Limited’s (ARTML) Chairman, said: “Ascott Reit achieved record high Unitholders’ distribution for the third consecutive year. Ascott Reit’s ability to deliver stable returns is a result of our efforts in building a geographically diversified portfolio of quality properties. We continued to strengthen Ascott Reit’s position as the largest hospitality REIT in Singapore by acquiring a prime site to build lyf one-north Singapore, our first coliving property.”

Mr Tan added: “As part of our proactive portfolio reconstitution strategy, we completed the divestment of two serviced residences in Shanghai and Xi’an in early 2018. The FY 2018 distribution included S$6.5 million, part of the net gains from the sale of these two properties. We also recently announced the sale of Ascott Raffles Place Singapore. These divestments will give Ascott Reit the financial flexibility to invest in new accretive opportunities that will enhance our portfolio and returns to Unitholders.”
In 4Q 2018, Ascott Reit’s key markets with strong operating performance include the United States, China and Japan. Gross profit for the United States surged 17%2, underpinned by higher demand and increased revenue from the upgraded apartments at Sheraton Tribeca New York Hotel. In China, excluding the contribution from Citadines Gaoxin Xi’an and Citadines Biyun Shanghai that were divested in January 2018, gross profit grew 16%2 as there were more guests on long stay. Similarly, Japan’s gross profit rose 12%2 due to stronger corporate and leisure demand in Tokyo.
Ms Beh Siew Kim, ARTML’s Chief Executive Officer, said: “Enhancing Unitholders’ returns through proactive asset management, including refurbishing our properties and leveraging technology, continues to be our priority. Our refurbished properties have not only created a better experience for guests, average daily rates for these properties have also increased about 10% to 20% due to stronger demand. During the year, we completed the refurbishments for Ascott Makati, Citadines Arnulfpark Munich, Citadines Trocadéro Paris, Somerset Grand Hanoi and Sheraton Tribeca New York Hotel. We are also carrying out refurbishment works at Somerset Grand Citra Jakarta and Element New York Times Square West, to be completed this year.”

The International Monetary Fund has revised its global economic growth forecast from 3.7% to 3.5%3 for 2019. The modest growth stems from economic uncertainties arising from trade tensions, uncertainties about Brexit and tighter financial markets. As for the hospitality industry, the number of international travellers is expected to increase by 6%4 in 2019. However, competition arising from new supply and higher operating costs may remain a challenge. With a well-diversified portfolio spanning over 14 countries and no earnings concentration risk in any single market, Ascott Reit remains resilient in providing stable returns to its Unitholders.
Ms Beh added: “While there are mixed views regarding further interest rate hikes in 2019, any possible increase is not expected to have any significant impact to Ascott Reit’s total returns. We maintain a disciplined and prudent approach towards capital management, with 80% of Ascott Reit’s total borrowings on fixed interest rates and a well-spread debt maturity where less than 5% of debt will mature in 2019. Ascott Reit’s gearing stands at a healthy 36.7%. We will continue to monitor and manage its interest rate and exchange rate exposure.”
Ascott Reit’s ‘BBB’ investment grade status by Fitch Ratings provides credit assurance to stakeholders, enabling Ascott Reit to raise funds at attractive rates and terms.
For 2018, Ascott Reit’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) breakdown (excluding corporate expenses) according to the FTSE classification of markets is 75% for developed markets.

CapitaLand obtains S$500 million sustainability-linked bilateral loan – the largest in Singapore’s real estate sector,"Over S$2.42 billion in total raised through sustainable finance in less than two years underscoring CapitaLand’s commitment to responsible growth
Records utilities cost avoidance of S$208 million since 2009 in latest Global Sustainability Report

















CapitaLand’s corporate offices across three locations in Singapore, including Capital Tower will be 100% powered by renewable energy by end 2020




Singapore, 28 May 2020 – CapitaLand has obtained a S$500 million sustainability-linked loan from United Overseas Bank (UOB), in tandem with the Group’s release of its 11th Global Sustainability Report which reports its sustainability performance in financial year 2019. The loan is the largest sustainability-linked bilateral loan in Singapore’s real estate sector. In total, CapitaLand and its real estate investment trusts have raised over S$2.42 billion [1] in less than two years, through sustainable financing instruments, reinforcing the Group’s commitment towards responsible growth.
The four-year S$500 million sustainability-linked loan from UOB is CapitaLand’s fifth sustainability-linked loan, the highest number of sustainability-linked loans obtained by a real estate company in Singapore. To date, CapitaLand has partnered with seven financial institutions to secure a total of 12 sustainable financing instruments comprising sustainability-linked loans, green loans and green bond.
The sustainability-linked loan from UOB is explicitly linked to CapitaLand’s achievements in the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark [2] (GRESB), a leading environmental, social and governance (ESG) benchmark for real estate and infrastructure investments across the world. 
In the GRESB 2019, CapitaLand came in first place across four categories and was also the leader in the Global ‘Diversified - Listed' category with the highest tier rating of 5 stars.












Given that the sustainability-linked loan is tied to the ESG performance of CapitaLand as a Group and not any specific project or property, CapitaLand has the flexibility to use the loan proceeds for general corporate purposes, unlike green loans where proceeds are specifically used for green projects. In addition, CapitaLand will obtain interest savings as it maintains or improves its rating on the benchmark.

CapitaLand had achieved interest savings on its existing sustainability-linked loans totalling S$600 million, with Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank, DBS, Natixis Bank and Société Générale. These sustainability-linked loans are explicitly linked to CapitaLand’s ESG efforts to maintain its listing on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index.
Mr Andrew Lim, Group Chief Financial Officer, CapitaLand Group said: “Integrating CapitaLand’s ESG performance with our financial metrics demonstrates the Group’s longterm focus on sustainability and responsible growth. CapitaLand continues to step up our ESG efforts and sustainable finance as they have delivered tangible returns for the Group. Through the sustainability-linked loans, CapitaLand has been able to capitalise on our achievements in ESG and add resilience to our capital position. Notwithstanding the current economic climate, we have raised S$1.5 billion in 2020 through sustainable finance. It is testament to the trust that our financial partners have in CapitaLand. With the support of our partners like UOB for our sustainable financing efforts, CapitaLand will continue to shape a sustainable built environment and enhance the communities we operate in.”

Mr Leong Yung Chee, Head of Corporate Banking Singapore, UOB, said: “At UOB, as we support the financial needs of our clients, we also pursue opportunities to progress our collective ESG responsibilities. CapitaLand’s commitment to building sustainable cities and communities and this sustainability-linked loan, the largest to-date in Singapore’s real estate sector, exemplify the collaborative efforts we seek with our clients to help them achieve responsible growth.”
Mr Ruben Langbroek, Head of Asia Pacific at GRESB, said: “GRESB assesses and benchmarks the ESG performance of real estate companies and funds, providing standardised and validated data to the most sophisticated capital providers in the property sector. CapitaLand has been a long-time participant in the annual GRESB Assessment and has shown a strong track record of adhering to best practices on material ESG issues. It’s great to see their ongoing commitment to further enhance their ESG performance demonstrated by this latest sustainability-linked loan based on their GRESB scores. As the number of green financing instruments grows around the world, this is benefitting real estate companies and funds with a strong ESG performance, and provides important incentives for the industry to transition to a low-carbon, safe and resilient future.”

CapitaLand achieves utilities cost avoidance of S$208 million since 2009
In CapitaLand’s 11th Global Sustainability Report released today, the Group reported that it has achieved utilities cost avoidance of S$208 million in 2019 since 2009. In the previous year, CapitaLand reported utilities cost avoidance of S$170 million since 2009.
In 2019, the Group’s energy and water consumption intensities were reduced by 19.2% and 22.4% respectively from the base year of 2008 [3]. CapitaLand also achieved a 29.4% reduction in carbon emissions intensity since 2008 [3].
In CapitaLand Group Chief Executive Officer’s message within the sustainability report, Mr Lee Chee Koon said: “For CapitaLand, true sustainability is the ability to weather the storm and emerge stronger. As a responsible global real estate company, we place sustainability at the core of what we do by contributing to the environmental and social well-being of our communities as we deliver long-term economic value. We are committed to navigating these difficult times with our staff, tenants, customers and partners in the ecosystem whilst ensuring our efforts are sustainable for our shareholders. CapitaLand has a strong balance sheet and we stand ready to capitalise on strategic opportunities for long-term growth. The COVID-19 pandemic has raised global awareness of the importance of ESG, as major disruptions to businesses can come from anywhere, including the environment. We are reviewing CapitaLand’s sustainability strategy with a view to setting a more ambitious sustainability roadmap, which will allow CapitaLand to better future-proof our company.”

Annex A  - CapitaLand has raised over S$2.42 billion in less than two years through sustainable finance

CapitaLand and its real estate investment trusts have raised over S$2.42 billion in less than two years, through sustainable financing instruments, reinforcing the Group’s commitment towards responsible growth.
In May 2020, CapitaLand secured a four-year S$500 million sustainability-linked loan from United Overseas Bank (UOB). This is the Group’s fifth sustainability-linked loan, the highest number of sustainability-linked loans for a real estate company in Singapore.
In April 2020, CapitaLand secured two green loans worth S$400 million to catalyse greening of its global portfolio. A S$150 million four-year green loan is provided by DBS while the S$250 million three-year multi-currency green loan is provided by The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited – Singapore Branch (HSBC).
In 1Q 2020, CapitaLand Commercial Trust (CCT) obtained S$600 million of green loans from HSBC, UOB and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited (OCBC). 
In December 2019, CCT set up a Sustainability Financing Framework which allowed CCT to secure funding from like-minded sustainability-centric investors. Under this Framework, CCT issued its first green bond comprising JPY10.0 billion (S$124.7 million) of unsecured bonds due in November 2027.
In October 2019, CapitaLand Mall Trust made its first foray into green financing to secure a S$200 million, five-year green loan from OCBC to finance or refinance its properties that have achieved Building and Construction Authority’s Green Mark certification.
In July 2019, CapitaLand clinched sustainability-linked loans with Credit Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank, Natixis Bank and Société Générale to raise a total of S$300 million, adding to the S$300 million sustainability-linked loan from DBS in October 2018.




Annex B – CapitaLand recognised as a leader in sustainability on GRESB

In 2019, CapitaLand and its real estate investment trusts came in first place across four categories in the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB). Globally, CapitaLand was the leader in the Global ‘Diversified - Listed' category with the highest tier rating of 5 stars. The 'Diversified - Listed' category includes publicly listed real estate companies with a diversified portfolio mix of asset types i.e. offices, retail, hospitality etc. In the region, CapitaLand was also the leader in the Asia-Pacific ‘Diversified’, Asia ‘Diversified’ and Asia ‘Diversified – Listed’ categories.
CapitaLand Mall Trust (CMT) came out top in the Asia ‘Retail – Listed’ category. CapitaLand, CMT, CapitaLand Commercial Trust and CapitaLand Retail China Trust also scored ‘A’ for public disclosure in GRESB 2019. GRESB was established in 2009 by a group of large pension funds who wanted to have access to comparable and reliable data on the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance of their investments. In the intervening years, it has grown to become the leading ESG benchmark for real estate and infrastructure investments across the world. GRESB’s ESG data covers US$4.5 trillion in real estate and infrastructure value and is used by more than 100 institutional and financial investors to make decisions that are leading to a more sustainable real asset industry.

CICT’s 2H 2023 distributable income up 2.1% year-on-year to S$362.5 million,"Proactive portfolio management and prudent cost management led to a 1.7% increase in distribution per unit to 5.45 cents for 2H 2023
Portfolio property value up 1.2% year-on-year to S$24.5 billion, bolstered by the Singapore portfolio 











Singapore, 6 February 2024 – CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust Management Limited (CICTML), the manager of CapitaLand Integrated Commercial Trust (CICT or the Trust), today reported a distributable income of S$362.5 million for the six months ended 31 December 2023 (2H 2023).  This marks a 2.1% year-on-year (y-o-y) increase compared to the S$355.1 million for 2H 2022.  The higher distributable income was underpinned by sound operational performance driven by proactive portfolio management and prudent cost management.
CICT's 2H 2023 distribution per unit (DPU) was 5.45 cents, up 1.7% y-o-y.  This brings the total DPU for FY 2023 to 10.75 cents, up 1.6% y-o-y, translating to a total return of 6.3%1.  Based on the closing price of S$2.06 per unit on 31 December 2023, CICT's distribution yield for FY 2023 was 5.2%.  With the record date on Thursday, 15 February 2024, CICT unitholders (Unitholders) can expect to receive their 2H 2023 DPU on Thursday, 28 March 2024. 
CICT is also pleased to announce a Distribution Reinvestment Plan (DRP) applicable to its 2H 2023 distribution.  The DRP provides Unitholders2 with the option to receive their 2H 2023 distribution in units, or a combination of both units and cash in lieu of the cash amount of distribution.  More details are shared in the Notice of Record Date and Distribution Payment Date dated 6 February 2024.

In FY 2023, gross revenue rose by 8.2% y-o-y to S$1,559.9 million and net property income grew by 7.0% y-o-y to S$1,115.9 million.  The better performance was largely attributed to higher contribution from Raffles City Singapore and the full-year contribution from acquisitions completed in 2022.  This was offset by higher finance costs from the full-year impact of borrowings taken to fund the acquisitions in 2022 and higher interest rates.

CICT's aggregate portfolio property value increased by 1.2% y-o-y to S$24.5 billion, based on CICT's proportionate interests in its investment properties and joint ventures as at 31 December 2023.  The uplift in portfolio property value was primarily driven by an improved operating performance of the Singapore portfolio, which grew in value by 2.0% y-o-y to S$23.0 billion.  This growth offset the decline in value of the overseas portfolio, which was impacted by the expansion in the capitalisation rate for the Australian properties and an increase in the terminal capitalisation rate for the Germany properties.  CICT's adjusted net asset value per unit, excluding distributable income, remained stable at S$2.07, from S$2.06 a year ago.

Ms Teo Swee Lian, Chairman of CICTML, said: ""In 2023, CICT adopted a conservative approach in response to challenging market conditions and a high-cost environment.  We focused on driving organic growth through proactive portfolio management, prudent cost management, and discipline in capital management.  This strategy has yielded positive results.  Despite the external circumstances, CICT's financial performance in 2H 2023 remained stable, highlighting the resilience and effective management of the portfolio.  Amidst prevailing global uncertainties, we will maintain a stance of caution and vigilance.  At the same time, our commitment to driving sustainable growth and returns remains steadfast.""












Mr Tony Tan, CEO of CICTML, said: ""CICT achieved improvements in operational performance across its retail, office and integrated development portfolios, as evidenced by the higher committed occupancies and positive rent reversions.  We have taken proactive measures to address headwinds in the Australia and Germany markets, by embarking on upgrading and asset enhancement initiatives that will drive stability and growth in our overseas portfolio.  Despite cost challenges, we have maintained resilience in our home ground.  The solid fundamentals of our Singapore portfolio have continued to serve as a strong anchor for CICT's growth, strengthening the overall value of our portfolio.""
""In 2024, our focus remains on optimising our portfolio for growth through proactive portfolio management, value creation, and prudent cost and capital management.  The limited new supply of retail and office spaces in Singapore over the medium term will contribute to the sustained demand for our properties.  On the value creation front, the transformation of CQ @ Clarke Quay into a vibrant day-and-night lifestyle destination is on the home stretch.  We are in the final stage of the asset enhancement works, and store fit-outs are progressing rapidly targeting to be in operations by 2Q 2024.  Three of our properties, namely, IMM Building in Singapore, Gallileo in Germany, and 101 Miller Street in Australia, are slated for upgrading and asset enhancement initiatives. Concurrently, we will explore opportunities that complement our portfolio as we remain predominantly Singapore-focused,"" added Mr Tan.

On the leasing front, CICT successfully signed approximately 1.7 million sq ft of new leases and renewals in FY 2023.  This comprised about 0.7 million sq ft of retail space and 1.0 million sq ft of office space.  In CICT's Singapore portfolio, tenant retention rates for retail and office leases in FY 2023 were 82.8% and 86.5%, respectively.  Rent reversions for the retail and office leases based on average committed rents in FY 2023 remained positive at 8.5% and 9.0%, respectively.

In FY 2023, our efforts to cultivate an engaging and immersive environment for shoppers resulted in an 8.6% growth in shopper traffic y-o-y.  Tenant sales per sq ft saw an increase of 1.8% y-o-y, buoyed by higher consumer spending.  Notably, the downtown malls experienced stronger growth, with shopper traffic and tenant sales per sq ft rising by 9.5% and 2.5% y-o-y, respectively, benefitting from an uptick in Singapore tourist arrivals and consumption.  

CICT's retail portfolio has attracted growing interest from Asian retailers across various trade categories.  In 4Q 2023, CICT's malls became home to several new-to-market brands.  Bugis Junction unveiled an exciting addition to Singapore's coffee scene with artisanal Indonesian coffee chain Fore Coffee, while Westgate tantalised taste buds with the debut of Bingz, offering a unique twist on crispy Chinese burgers.  Bedok Mall launched the first official store of fashion-forward footwear brand VIVAIA, infusing vibrant and fresh energy into Singapore's fashion scene. 
In 4Q 2023, our office portfolio attracted new tenants, primarily from sectors such as IT, Media and Telecommunications, Real Estate and Property Services and Financial Services.

Value creation for sustainable growth 
CICT will continue to optimise its portfolio with three upgrading and asset enhancement initiatives (AEI) in 2024.  
Slated for a S$48.0 million AEI, IMM Building will launch its four-phase enhancement in 1Q 2024 to strengthen its position as a regional outlet destination.  Targeting a return on investment of about 8%, the AEI will focus on sharpening IMM Building’s tenant mix and further enhancing shoppers' experience.  There will be a strategic rightsizing of the supermarket's footprint and unit reconfigurations on the ground floor's 126,000 sq ft of net lettable area (NLA).  The enhancements will extend to refreshing common areas and upgrading mall amenities, including toilets.  The AEI will also incorporate the installation of more energy-efficient equipment to align with our environmental sustainability objectives.  The mall will remain operational throughout the AEI and the final phase is anticipated to conclude in 3Q 2025.  Notably, the initial two phases have already garnered close to 70% pre-commitment, including those under advanced negotiations, reflecting robust market interest.
Commencing in February 2024, Gallileo in Frankfurt, Germany, will embark on a planned AEI in three phases to elevate the property's relevance, functionality and operational efficiency with a target to achieve a minimum green rating target of LEED Gold.  At an estimated cost of between €175 and €215 million3, the AEI will elevate the property to modern Grade A office specifications, with works to improve the mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems.  A downtime of at least 18 months is expected for the AEI.
In North Sydney, Australia, 101 Miller Street will undergo an approximately A$9 million upgrade to transform its lobby into a best-in-class multifunctional communal space in supporting tenants' return to office.  With the introduction of concierge services and a café/bar managed by coworking and executive space operator Work Club, the space will evolve into a lively social hub for tenants and guests, fostering connections and enhancing the overall tenant experience.  Set for completion in 2Q 2024, the upgrade will also improve the connectivity to Greenwood Plaza and the broader precinct, improving the overall accessibility and user experience of the integrated development.
 







Disciplined and prudent capital management
In line with our commitment to prudent capital management, CICT continued to diversify its funding sources with flexibility and agility.  CICT's debt maturity is well spread over various tenures, with an average term to maturity of 3.9 years.
In FY 2023, we increased our commitment to green financing by issuing green bonds and sustainability-linked loan facilities totalling S$2.2 billion.  The total outstanding sustainability-linked/green loan facilities and green bond issuance was S$4.2 billion as at 31 December 2023.  This accounted for 41.8% of CICT's total borrowings (including its proportionate share of JV borrowings) as at 31 December 2023.

As at 31 December 2023, CICT maintained an aggregate leverage of 39.9% with an average cost of debt of 3.4%.  Of CICT's total borrowings, approximately 78% were on fixed interest rate.  CICT's credit ratings from Standard & Poor's and Moody's remained at ""A-"" and ""A3"", respectively.

CRCT’s 2Q 2019 net property income increases 11.5% year-on-year,"Facade of CapitaMall Xuefu
	            
	        






Singapore, 31 July 2019 – CapitaLand Retail China Trust Management Limited (CRCTML), the manager of CapitaLand Retail China Trust (CRCT), announced today that it achieved a higher net property income1 (NPI) of RMB201.1 million for the period 1 April 2019 to 30 June 2019 (2Q 2019), an increase of 11.5% from RMB180.4 million for the same period in 2018. For the period 1 January 2019 to 30 June 2019 (1H 2019), NPI1 grew 11.1% year-on-year to RMB400.0 million.  The better performance was attributed to stronger rental growth across CRCT’s core multi-tenanted malls and lower operating expenses.
Income available for distribution to Unitholders in 2Q 2019 rose 5.0% year-on-year to S$25.4 million, of which contribution from Rock Square increased by 23.6% to S$2.5 million.  Distribution per unit (DPU) for the quarter was 2.54 cents.  On a comparable basis, core DPU excluding capital distribution was up 2.0% year-on-year, extending the growth of 1Q 2019. Based on CRCT’s closing price of S$1.60 on 30 July 2019, the annualised distribution yield for the quarter was 6.4%.    
Mr Tan Tze Wooi, CEO of CRCTML, said: “Despite global market headwinds and trade tensions, China’s economy registered steady growth at 6.2% for 2Q 2019, in line with market expectations.  The continued rise in national urban disposable income per capita of 8.0% for the first half of 2019 indicates momentum in the increasing spending power of China’s middle class, a trend which CRCT malls are well-placed to benefit from.”


















“Our proactive asset management efforts continue to yield positive results, with 1H 2019 rental reversions averaging 7.5%.  New leases signed include popular brands and refreshing concepts that resonated with shoppers and enhanced our malls’ appeal as social spaces for families and young shoppers.  Our effective leasing strategy has led to increases in shopper traffic and tenants’ sales, both of which grew by 6.7% in 1H 2019.   Portfolio occupancy as at 30 June 2019 remained strong at 97.0%.”







“Our prudent capital management approach has provided financial flexibility to support our expansion.  Further to divesting CapitaMall Wuhu2, we have reoriented our focus towards our core portfolio centred on Tier 1 and provincial capital cities.  In 2Q 2019, we announced our proposed acquisitions3 of CapitaMall Xuefu and CapitaMall Aidemengdun in Harbin and CapitaMall Yuhuating in Changsha.  These three quality assets with strong and steady yields add immediate strengths to CRCT’s portfolio while offering upside from potential asset enhancement initiatives.  Their proposed additions are in line with our overall plans to rejuvenate and strengthen CRCT’s portfolio mix and will strategically position CRCT to scale up in the long term.""
CRCT has completed all term loan refinancing due in 2019 and have early refinanced part of the loans due in 2020.  About 80% of CRCT’s total term loans is on fixed interest rates, providing certainty of interest expenses.  To mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, CRCT hedged approximately 50% of its distributable income into Singapore dollars.  As at end June 2019, CRCT’s gearing was a healthy 33.8%, well below the regulatory limit of 45%.

Singapore, 12 November 2023 – CapitaLand Development (CLD) is pleased to report strong sales for the highly-anticipated launch of J’den, which commenced bookings at 10am on Saturday, 11 November 2023.  By the end of the launch day, 323 units or 88% of the total 368 units have been sold at an average selling price of S$2,451 per square foot.  The robust performance earns J’den the distinction of Singapore’s best-selling new launch year-to-date by percentage of units sold.
More than 99% of the homebuyers are Singaporeans and Singapore Permanent Residents, and close to 60% of them are aged 40 years old or below.  About 62% of the homebuyers currently reside in the western region of Singapore.
All unit types have been well-received on launch day, with the one- and two-bedroom types being the most popular.  All 148 units of the one-bedroom, one-bedroom plus study and two-bedroom types have sold out.  There is also strong take-up for the larger three- and four-bedroom units by owner-occupiers.

J’den is strategically located in Jurong Gateway, the commercial hub of Jurong Lake District (JLD), with direct connectivity to the Jurong East MRT interchange station via J-Walk, a covered and elevated pedestrian crossing.  With plans for JLD to be eventually served by four MRT lines, J’den residents will enjoy excellent connectivity to the rest of Singapore.  Comprising a 38-storey residential tower above a two-storey retail podium, J’den is set to become the tallest mixed-use development in JLD.  Unit sizes range from 527 square feet (sq ft) for a one-bedroom unit to 1,485 sq ft for a four-bedroom unit.







Mr Tan Yew Chin, CEO of CLD (Singapore), said: “We are glad to harness CapitaLand’s deep knowledge of JLD to craft a residential development that meets the aspirations of homebuyers eager to embrace the area’s growth.  Homebuyers are drawn to J’den’s unparalleled location with seamless access to an array of amenities, in addition to its comprehensive facilities and superb views of Jurong Lake Gardens.  We look forward to further leveraging CapitaLand’s leadership in JLD to create more quality real estate products and services that contribute to the district’s transformation.”

J’den – Where it all comes together
In addition to connectivity to the Jurong East MRT station, J’den is linked via J-Walk to major shopping malls such as Westgate, IMM and JEM, as well as the upcoming Jurong East Integrated Transport Hub, which will include an air-conditioned bus interchange, a public library, a community club and a sports centre amongst other commercial spaces.
The apartments in J’den are predominantly oriented to the coveted north-south facing, providing residents with either picturesque views of Jurong Lake Gardens or the cityscape.  The premium three-bedroom plus study units and four-bedroom units are served by private lifts, for added exclusivity.
To enhance homebuyers’ flexibility in space planning, J’den offers non-prefabricated pre-finished volumetric construction (non-PPVC) units with fewer structural walls.  The induction hob in the one-bedroom units and two-bedroom units is discreetly concealed underneath the kitchen countertop, resulting in an expansive countertop that doubles as a home office area.  J’den is the first private residential development in Singapore to introduce apartments equipped with concealed induction hob technology.

OCBC Bank Partners CapitaLand On Singapore's First SORA-based Loan,"Singapore, 16 June 2020 – OCBC Bank and CapitaLand have inked Singapore’s first loan facility agreement referencing Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA). The S$150 million three-year corporate loan from OCBC Bank to CapitaLand is a milestone in the industry’s transition roadmap towards adopting SORA as the new interest rate benchmark for the Singapore Dollar cash and derivatives markets.
The S$150 million loan is part of a S$300 million sustainability-linked loan extended by OCBC Bank to CapitaLand. Proceeds from the facility will be used for general corporate purposes.
The loan facility’s interest rate, which references SORA, comprises two components: (1) a compounded average of daily SORA rates calculated in arrears and (2) an applicable margin.







SORA is a backward-looking overnight rate as compared to forward-looking reference rates commonly used for loan facilities in Singapore, such as the SGD Swap Offer Rate (SOR) where the interest rate is determined at the start of the interest period. To determine the interest rate of a SORA-based loan facility, the daily SORA rates are compounded in arrears and the interest rate is determined by the end of the relevant interest period.
A summary of the key differences between SOR and SORA is set out below:


 

SOR

SORA

Definition

Effective rate of borrowing SGD synthetically, by borrowing USD and swapping for SGD.

Average rate of unsecured overnight interbank SGD transactions in Singapore.

Methodology and inputs

Volume-weighted average rate of USD/ SGD FX swap transactions, with USD London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as an input.

Volume-weighted average rate of transactions reported by Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).

Tenor

Overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month

Overnight


Source: Association of Banks in Singapore

Globally, several major jurisdictions have identified overnight rates as alternative benchmark rates to LIBOR in their respective currencies, and the industry is trending towards the use of backward-looking, compounded-in-arrears rates.
For Singapore’s inaugural SORA-based loan facility, the compounded average SORA will be calculated in arrears, using the ‘Five-business day backward-shifted observation period’ methodology.
Refer to Annex A for an illustration on how this methodology works.
The use of a compounded average SORA calculated in arrears has several benefits:

 SORA is accessible and has been published on the MAS website daily since 1 July 2005. 
SORA is a robust benchmark underpinned by a deep and liquid overnight interbank funding market and not susceptible to manipulation.
The averaging effect of compounded SORA rates will result in more stable rates, compared to forward-looking term rates, such as SOR, which are exposed to idiosyncratic market factors on a single day’s fixing, such as quarterly and year-end volatility.
SORA has been identified as the alternative benchmark rate for Singapore Dollar derivatives. Hence, pegging cash products to the same benchmark allows for effective hedging as the basis risk between cash and derivatives markets is minimised.

OCBC Bank had previously executed Singapore’s first overnight indexed swap derivatives transaction using SORA as the reference rate in November 2019. It was also a party to the first Singapore dollar interest rate swap referencing SORA, cleared by LCH, a leading global clearing house, in May 2020.
In August 2019, the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) and the Singapore Foreign Exchange Market Committee identified SORA as the most suitable interest rate benchmark to replace the SOR. This change is necessary as the long-term viability of SOR, which utilises the USD LIBOR in its computation, would be impacted by the expected discontinuation of the USD LIBOR after 31 December 2021.
An industry-led Steering Committee for the transition (SC-STS), comprising senior representatives from key banks, relevant industry associations, and MAS was established in August 2019. Chaired by Mr Samuel Tsien, OCBC Group CEO and ABS Chairman, the SC-STS is responsible for providing strategic direction on industry proposals to develop new products and markets based on SORA, and to engage with stakeholders to seek feedback and raise awareness on issues related to the transition from SOR to SORA.
Said Ms Elaine Lam, Head, Global Corporate Banking, OCBC Bank, “We are pleased to be working with CapitaLand on Singapore’s first SORA-pegged loan, which is an important first step for the industry transition from SOR to SORA. This deal will provide guidance for the development of SORA-pegged loans, pave the way for greater market acceptance and help such loans gain traction in the market. This landmark SORA-pegged loan, being a sustainability-linked loan, deeply resonates with OCBC’s and CapitaLand’s shared commitment to advancing green finance in Singapore.”

















Said Mr Andrew Lim, Group Chief Financial Officer, CapitaLand Group, “CapitaLand’s pioneer adoption of the SORA-based loan enables us to contribute to how SORA will be understood, structured and priced, in the process preparing the groundwork for mainstream adoption in the future. It also positions CapitaLand well as we embark on our own gradual transition. With the support of a like-minded partner in OCBC, we are able to dovetail this important innovation in Singapore’s financial ecosystem with our commitment to our environmental, social and governance efforts. We will continue to advocate and pursue responsible growth and sustainability as a Group.”
In total, CapitaLand and its real estate investment trusts have raised over S$2.72 billion in less than two years through sustainable financing.

 *IBOR Refers to Interbank Offered Rate










The daily SORA rates are compounded in arrears over the observation period.
Interest amount will be a product of (i) outstanding principal (ii) compounded-in-arrears SORA and an applicable margin (iii) number of days in the interest period divided by 365.
The interest amount in respect of an interest period will be determined after the end of the observation period and prior to the end of such interest period and is payable on an agreed date. (For illustration purposes, the interest payment date is assumed to be the last day of the interest period.)   

























Annex B - Details on the sustainability-linked loan and CapitaLand’s sustainable financing efforts


With the S$300 million sustainability-linked loan from OCBC Bank, CapitaLand and its real estate investment trusts have raised over S$2.72 billion in under two years through sustainable financing, reinforcing the Group’s commitment towards responsible growth. This is CapitaLand’s sixth sustainability-linked loan, the highest number of sustainability-linked loans obtained by a real estate company in Singapore.
CapitaLand Group has partnered with seven financial institutions to secure a total of 13 sustainable financing instruments comprising sustainability-linked loans, green loans and a green bond since 2018.
The sustainability-linked loan is explicitly tied to CapitaLand’s environment, social and governance (ESG) performance and achievements in the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB), a leading ESG benchmark for real estate and infrastructure investments across the world. CapitaLand will obtain interest savings as it maintains or improves its rating on the benchmark. This is CapitaLand’s second sustainability-linked loan to be tied to GRESB.
In 2019, CapitaLand had achieved interest savings on its previous S$600 million sustainability-linked loans. These sustainability-linked loans are explicitly linked to CapitaLand’s ESG efforts to maintain its listing on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index.

UOB collaborates with CapitaLand on Singapore’s first dual tranche SORA-SOFR loan,"Singapore, 3 September 2020 – United Overseas Bank Limited (UOB) and CapitaLand today announced that they have entered into an agreement for a two-year S$200 million term loan. The dual tranche loan, which references both the Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA)[1] and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)[2], is the first of its kind in Singapore.
The bilateral loan facility between UOB and CapitaLand comes ahead of a global transition from Interbank Offer Rates, including the London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR)[3], to alternative risk-free rates (RFRs). As RFRs are overnight interest rate benchmarks based on actual transactions, they are more transparent and more reflective of market conditions. SORA and SOFR have been identified by the relevant regulatory and industry bodies as the alternative benchmark rates to replace the Swap Offer Rate (SOR) in Singapore and the US Dollar LIBOR respectively.







The interest rate on the loan’s two tranches will be based on the compounded averages of daily SORA and SOFR, both calculated in arrears, and with respective applicable margins[4]. The loan proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.
Mr Leong Yung Chee, Head of Corporate Banking Singapore, UOB, said, “The dual tranche SORA-SOFR loan facility is yet another milestone that reflects the strength of UOB’s longstanding relationship with CapitaLand[5]. It is also a major step in driving the adoption of new benchmark rates for financial products in Singapore. We will continue to work closely with the regulators, industry partners and our clients for a smooth transition process.”








Mr Andrew Lim, Group Chief Financial Officer, CapitaLand Group, said, “With our first SORA-SOFR dual tranche structure, CapitaLand continues to proactively prepare for the global transition to alternative benchmark rates. As a globally diversified real estate company, CapitaLand’s early adoption of these new interest rate benchmarks across different currencies enables us to work with our key banking partners such as UOB, to ensure that the Group’s ongoing transition of our loan book to alternative benchmark rates proceeds smoothly.”

















Through this collaboration, UOB and CapitaLand aim to enhance market confidence in adopting SORA, which will in turn help accelerate the transition from the use of SOR to SORA. This is in line with the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s initiatives to support the adoption of SORA as a key interest rate benchmark in Singapore and the development of vibrant and robust SORA markets[6].
In June 2020, CapitaLand was the first company in Singapore to obtain a SORA-based loan and continues to pave the way for greater market acceptance of SORA- and SOFR-based interest rate benchmarks.

 [3] The Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom announced that it would not compel banks contributing to the calculation of LIBOR to continue doing so beyond 2021. This means that LIBOR may be discontinued and/or it may be declared as non-representative prior to actual cessation.
 [4] The daily rates of SORA and SOFR will be compounded in arrears respectively over the observation period using a day-weight shift methodology, which commences five business days preceding the first day (inclusive) of the interest period to five business days preceding the last day (exclusive) of the interest period. Payable on an agreed date, the interest amount for each tranche in respect of an interest period – calculated based on the outstanding loan principal, the compounded-in-arrears SORA or SOFR, an applicable margin and the number of days in the interest period divided by 365 (for SORA) or 360 (for SOFR), will be determined after the end of the observation period and prior to the end of such interest period.  
 [5] In May 2020, UOB provided CapitaLand with a S$500 million sustainability-linked loan, which remains the largest sustainability-linked loan in Singapore’s real estate sector.
