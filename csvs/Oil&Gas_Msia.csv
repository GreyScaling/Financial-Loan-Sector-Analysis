"This article first appeared in The Edge Malaysia Weekly, on January 25 - 31, 2016."," BANKS are growing increasingly cautious about granting loans not just to oil and gas (O&G) companies but also to individuals who work in the sector. Industry sources say they deem the sector vulnerable to loan defaults amid a prolonged slump in O&G upstream activities even as the price of crude oil, which plunged to 12-year lows last week, shows little sign of recovering. Bank Simpanan Nasional (BSN), for one, confirmed last Thursday that it is tightening rules on the approval of new loans and credit products to employees in the O&G sector. The move is a temporary measure and reflects “prudent risk management” on its part, the bank says in a press statement. “BSN is the latest but many of the banks are already doing this, perhaps not officially — meaning there’s nothing in writing — but we tell our people, based on an opinion from the risk management side, to be careful about extending loans to upstream companies. And to shy away from extending personal loans, car loans and credit cards to individuals working in O&G. Many have lost their jobs or are at risk of losing their jobs and our worry is that they won’t be able to service loans,” a top official at a local bank tells The Edge. “It’s not O&G across the board ... it’s the upstream sector that we consider vulnerable as it’s suffering from prolonged low oil prices. The downstream side is doing fine,” the official adds. Upstream refers to oil and gas exploration and production activities. Brent crude oil dropped below US$30 a barrel for the first time in 12 years on Jan 13. As at press time last Thursday, Brent futures for March delivery was trading at just above US$28 a barrel on continued concerns about a supply overhang and the outlook for demand. Iran’s return to the oil market this month, following the lifting of international sanctions, adds to the global glut. Oil has dropped some 75% since June 2014. Already, many O&G companies have retrenched staff. Shell Malaysia, for instance, announced in September last year that it would reduce about 1,300 positions from its upstream division over the next two years. The company has a total workforce of about 6,500. Last Tuesday, it was reported that Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) plans to slash spending by up to RM50 billion over the next four years and review its business structure in response to the prolonged slump in oil prices, on top of the earlier cut. “The news [about Petronas] … reinforces the slump in the local O&G industry to be deeper and longer than our earlier expectations. [This is] bad news for upstream and asset players,” Hong Leong Investment Bank Research says in a Jan 20 report on the sector. It has a “neutral” call on the sector, like many other analysts. But it points out that the downstream side of the O&G sector is booming. “In contrast to upstream players, downstream players, especially refiners, have benefited from the crude oil price trend due to improvement in refining margin.” Bankers point out that when individual borrowers run into financial difficulties, they tend to try to continue to service their home loans but slack on their credit card and car loan repayments. “Under current banking guidelines, even if they made partial payments on their loan, after three months in a row, the banks would have to classify it non-performing,” one points out. Bank Negara Malaysia should be less rigid on how it expects banks to look at non-performing loans (NPL) amid tougher times now, he suggests. The moves to tighten lending to the O&G sector come as banks are already keeping a close watch on their asset quality as the economy weakens. The banking industry’s gross NPL ratio was marginally higher at 1.61% as at November 2015 compared with 1.59% a month earlier, Bank Negara’s latest data shows. On a month-on-month basis, the NPL ratios for automotive, personal loans and working capital loans edged up. “Ironically, in better times, it’s the O&G sector that banks liked to lend to because it’s perceived to be stable, with deep pockets,” a banker remarks. BSN issued the press statement last week in response to news reports that it was freezing approvals for loan applications by employees working in the O&G sector. The reports were based on a screen shot of an internal bank email that had been circulating on instant messaging applications. The Jan 19 email had said that new applications for all personal loans, credit cards and hire purchase loans from employees in the O&G sector were to be rejected upfront, with immediate effect. An exemption would only be given to non-contract employees of Petronas but these applications had to get approval from the bank’s headquarters first. “BSN would like to confirm that it [the tightening of rules] is part of an internal memo circulated by management as a specific precautionary measure,” it said in the press statement. The statement says that it is part of its standard procedure to consistently review developments in the financial and economic sector that may have an impact on its business. “This includes taking note of industries facing challenges, such as the situation experienced by the O&G industry currently. The proposed tightening of loan and credit approvals is a temporary measure in line with the general expectations for prudent risk management.” Save by subscribing to us for your print and/or digital copy.

ICLG - Oil & Gas Laws and Regulations -,"Malaysia Chapter covers common issues in oil and gas laws and regulations – including development of oil and natural gas, import/export of natural gas, LNG, import/export of oil, transportation, transmission and distribution and foreign investment.  ICLG.com > Practice Areas > Oil & Gas Regulation > Malaysia         1.1        A brief outline of your jurisdiction’s natural gas sector, including a general description of: natural gas reserves; natural gas production including the extent to which production is associated or non-associated natural gas; import and export of natural gas, including liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) liquefaction and export facilities, and/or receiving and re-gasification facilities (“LNG facilities”); natural gas pipeline transportation and distribution/transmission network; natural gas storage; and commodity sales and trading. Malaysia, whilst sitting close to the middle among its South East Asian neighbours in terms of gross domestic product (“GDP”), boasts the second-largest oil and gas production in the region and was the fifth-largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) in the world in 2019, accounting for 7% of LNG exports worldwide (BP 2020 Statistical Review of World Energy).  Both the peninsular and Borneo states, Sabah and Sarawak, have an abundance of natural deposits.  In 2020, approximately 73.2 billion cubic metres of natural gas were produced in Malaysia, with the country holding 41.8 trillion cubic feet (“Tcf”) of proved natural gas reserves as at January 2020 (Oil & Gas Journal, “Worldwide Look at Reserves and Production”, 2nd December 2019). Petroliam Nasional Bhd (“PETRONAS”), Malaysia’s national oil and natural gas company, established in 1974, holds exclusive rights for all natural gas exploration and production in Malaysia.  Petroleum Sarawak Bhd (“Petros”), Sarawak’s state-owned oil and natural gas company, controls the distribution, supply and sale of natural gas in said state.  Apart from these two local major players, Royal Dutch Shell (“Shell”) is a major natural gas producer in Malaysia and is heavily involved in the development of deep-water fields in Malaysia.  Companies such as ExxonMobil, Pertamina and JX Nippon Oil & Gas are other oil and natural gas companies with a sizeable stake in Malaysian natural gas fields. In order to meet the needs of the country, two onshore regasification terminals, one in Sungai Udang, Melaka and the other in Pengerang, Johor, with a total regasification capacity of 351 billion cubic feet per year, have been developed and connected to the major natural gas pipeline network, which not only transports natural gas for domestic use but also for export to Singapore.  Malaysia also has six liquefaction terminals, two of which are floating LNG (“FLNG”) facilities, with a total capacity of 1,478 billion cubic feet per year (U.S. Energy Information Administration, last updated 25th January 2021).  A third FLNG is being considered, with studies currently under way ([Hyperlink] ). Natural gas is transported through a vast and extensive pipeline network totalling over 2,500 km in length, with the majority of the network situated in peninsular Malaysia and known as the Peninsular Gas Utilisation (“PGU”) network.  Pipelines in the states of Sabah and Sarawak are mostly limited to transporting natural gas to power plants for power generation or to LNG terminals for export. 1.2        To what extent are your jurisdiction’s energy requirements met using natural gas (including LNG)? Natural gas accounts for approximately 36% of Malaysia’s primary energy consumption.  Oil and other liquids account for 37%, coal 21% and renewable energy 6% (BP 2020 Statistical Review of World Energy). 1.3        To what extent are your jurisdiction’s natural gas requirements met through domestic natural gas production? Malaysia’s 2018 annual natural gas production was approximately 2.5 Tcf, with domestic consumption taking up less than half that amount for the same year (U.S. Energy Information Administration).  Various reports do, however, suggest that Malaysia’s recent natural gas consumption has exceeded its production, with natural gas imported from Indonesia to meet local demands. 1.4        To what extent is your jurisdiction’s natural gas production exported (pipeline or LNG)? Natural gas exports exceeded imports by a net of over 1 billion cubic feet per year for most of the past decades with Japan, China and South Korea being the three largest importers of Malaysia’s LNG.  In 2019, China accounted for 38% of all LNG exports, with Japan a close second with 36% and South Korea with 19% (BP 2020 Statistical Review of World Energy.  Taiwan exports included as part of China). 2.1        Please provide a brief outline of your jurisdiction’s oil sector. Malaysia is one of the key oil producers in the Asia-Pacific region, with an estimated 600,000 barrels of crude oil per day produced in 2019.  As at the start of 2020, the country held proved oil reserves of approximately 3.6 billion barrels, the second largest in South East Asia after Vietnam and fourth largest in the Asia-Pacific region.  Total liquid fuels production is estimated at over 700,000 barrels per day (U.S. Energy Information Administration).  The majority, if not all, of Malaysia’s oil comes from offshore fields, primarily off the coast of the states of Terengganu (peninsular), Sabah and Sarawak (Oil & Gas Journal, “Worldwide Look at Reserves and Production”).  PETRONAS holds exclusive rights for oil exploration and production in Malaysia. Malaysia boasts some of the highest quality of crude blends.  Five common crude blends, Kikeh, Kimanis, Labuan, Miri and Tapis, are found in offshore fields, with the Tapis blend found in the Malay basin located in the peninsular region known for its high quality (“Tapis”, ExxonMobil, 21st November 2018). The largest commercial oil storage facility is located in Pengerang, Johor, the country’s southernmost state, with a capacity for storage of over 2 million cubic metres for crude oil and petroleum products ( [Hyperlink] ).  Plans for the construction of a crude oil storage and refining facility in Sipitang Oil & Gas Industrial Park in Sabah were approved in 2021 ( [Hyperlink] ). Malaysia mainly relies on tankers to distribute oil products onshore.  An interconnecting oil products pipeline runs from the Melaka refinery through Shell’s Port Dickson refinery to the Klang Valley airport and Klang oil distribution centre.  A 200 km pipeline runs from the Tapis oil field to the Kerteh plant in Terengganu.  The Kerteh plant is also serviced by the 230 km Jerneh condensate pipeline.  Oil pipelines also connect offshore oil fields in Sabah with the onshore Labuan Crude Oil Terminal ( [Hyperlink] ). Malaysia has eight refineries, with an oil refining capacity of over 900,000 barrels per day (FACTS Global Energy, Asia Pacific Databook 2: Refinery Configuration & Construction, Spring 2020).  A further refinery in Pengerang is under construction. 2.2        To what extent are your jurisdiction’s energy requirements met using oil? Oil and other liquids account for 37% of Malaysia’s primary energy consumption (ibid.). 2.3        To what extent are your jurisdiction’s oil requirements met through domestic oil production? There was little disparity in the importation and export of crude oil in 2019, with approximately 270,000 barrels per day of oil imported for processing at oil refineries and 276,000 barrels per day exported (U.S. Energy Information Administration and Global Trade Tracker).  Various reports do, however, suggest that Malaysia’s oil consumption has exceeded its production in the last 10 years. 2.4        To what extent is your jurisdiction’s oil production exported? The majority of crude oil exports were shipped within the Asia Pacific, with Australia, India, Thailand and Singapore accounting for 25%, 23%, 20% and 15%, respectively (U.S. Energy Information Administration and Global Trade Tracker).  In 2019, Malaysia exported USD7.88 billion in crude oil, making it the 24th largest exporter of crude oil in the world.  Crude oil was the sixth-most-exported product in Malaysia that year ( [Hyperlink] ). 3.1        Outline broadly the legal/statutory and organisational framework for the exploration and production (“development”) of oil and natural gas reserves including: principal legislation; in whom the State’s mineral rights to oil and natural gas are vested; Government authority or authorities responsible for the regulation of oil and natural gas development; and current major initiatives or policies of the Government (if any) in relation to oil and natural gas development. The Petroleum Development Act, 1975 (“PDA”), the main legislation governing the oil and gas industry in Malaysia, was introduced in 1975 and vested PETRONAS with the entire ownership, and the exclusive rights, powers, liberties and privileges of exploring and exploiting petroleum resources, both onshore and offshore, in exchange for payments to the Federal Government and State Governments involved. The Petroleum Regulations, 1974 further provide PETRONAS with the rights to issue licences to any contractors to commence and continue any business or service pertaining to upstream activities.  A contractor wishing to participate in exploration and production activities must apply for and receive a licence from the Malaysia Petroleum Management (“MPM”) division of PETRONAS. The Petroleum Regulations, 1974 also stipulate that companies wishing to supply goods and services to the upstream oil and gas sector shall also obtain a licence from PETRONAS.  Licensing and registration for providers of goods and services is undertaken by PETRONAS Group Procurement, which is separate from MPM ( [Hyperlink] ). Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd (“PCSB”), on the other hand, is PETRONAS’s exploration and production subsidiary.  PCSB is required to be party to any production sharing contract (“PSC”) that essentially grants exploration rights to companies. The key laws and regulations relating to the oil and natural gas industry in Malaysia, apart from the PDA, are (non-exhaustive): Amendments to the Petroleum Regulations, 1974 in January 1991 resulted in the Ministry of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs (“MDTCA”) and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (“MITI”) taking responsibility of regulating activities in the downstream sector.  MDTCA issues licences for marketing and distribution of oil products, whereas MITI issues licences for the processing and refining of oil and the manufacture of petrochemical products. Registration or licensing requirements As previously stated, PETRONAS essentially holds a monopoly on the oil and natural gas sector in Malaysia.  Pursuant to the PDA, contractors are required to enter into contracts with PETRONAS in order to acquire the right to explore and produce oil and natural gas.  Contractors enter into PSCs or risk service contracts (“RSCs”) for this purpose.  A licence from PETRONAS must also be obtained for goods and service providers related to upstream operations, again in the form of a PSC or RSC.  The upstream sector includes, but is not limited to, the exploration, development and production of oil and gas. PETRONAS licensing guidelines, which can be found on the PETRONAS official website, set out the requirements to apply for a PETRONAS licence for the upstream sector as well as for registration to participate in PETRONAS tenders for downstream activities.  The issuance of a licence is subject to a licence fee as stipulated in the Petroleum Regulations, 1974.  No registration fee is applicable for participating in tender for supply of goods and services to the downstream sector.  PETRONAS licence and registration is usually for three years, unless the contractor company has been incorporated for less than 18 months from the date of application, in which case the validity is for two years. Obtaining a PETRONAS licence enables a contractor to supply goods and services to both upstream and downstream sectors, whereas a valid registration only enables participation in downstream sectors. A contractor must comply with the following in order to obtain a PETRONAS licence or registration.  First, the contractor must be locally incorporated, i.e., registered with the Companies Commission as either a private limited or public listed company.  The contractor company must have paid-up capital (ordinary shares) of at least RM100,000 to obtain a licence or RM10,000 for registration.  Professional firms, i.e., architects, engineers and the like, must be registered with the local relevant professional bodies.  Capital contribution for licence or registration is the same for contractor companies.  The second requirement is that the company’s assets must exceed its liability (positive shareholder’s fund). The contractor company or professional firm also must comply with the Standardised Work and Equipment Categories (“SWEC”).  SWEC refers to the list of work categories of the upstream and downstream oil and gas operational activities and are divided into Product SWEC and Service SWEC.  A company must comply with SWEC requirements, which cover the minimum Bumiputera requirements at equity, board of directors, management and employee levels and meet the minimum technical requirements and certification by external bodies as specified depending on the code allocated for such service.  The list of SWEC work categories can be found on PETRONAS’s website ( [Hyperlink] ).  All applications for licence and registration can be made online through PETRONAS’s website. Bumiputera requirements refer to the local indigenous people.  Pursuant to the New Economic Policy and subsequent new policies, including the National Vision Policy, Malaysia had implemented policies with an objective to ensure a minimum fixed percentage of Bumiputera participation in all industries for the purpose of what was deemed a balanced development.  The oil and natural gas industry is no exception, with SWEC’s minimum Bumiputera requirements ranging from 100%, 51% and 30%.  There are a very limited number of services that require no Bumiputera participation. A foreign company may apply for a PETRONAS licence or registration, but only by either appointing a local company that meets all of the above requirements as an agent to serve as a local representative and service provider, or by forming a joint venture company with a local company or individual that complies with all requirements. 3.2        How are the State’s mineral rights to develop oil and natural gas reserves transferred to investors or companies (“participants”) (e.g., licence, concession, service contract, contractual rights under Production Sharing Agreement?) and what is the legal status of those rights or interests under domestic law? As stated above, PETRONAS holds exclusive rights over the development of oil and natural gas in Malaysia.  Parties can, however, enter into a PSC with PETRONAS with authentication by the King, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong or state ruler, or the Yang di-Pertuan Negeri for the affected land.  Regulations on authorisation, fees and terms and conditions imposed for the affected land are contained in the Petroleum Mining Act, 1966. 3.3        If different authorisations are issued in respect of different stages of development (e.g., exploration appraisal or production arrangements), please specify those authorisations and briefly summarise the most important (standard) terms (such as term/duration, scope of rights, expenditure obligations). PETRONAS is the go-to party for upstream activities, whereas for the downstream sector, MDTCA issues licences for the marketing and distribution of oil products and MITI issues licences for the processing and refining of oil and the manufacture of petrochemical products. 3.4        To what extent, if any, does the State have an ownership interest, or seek to participate, in the development of oil and natural gas reserves (whether as a matter of law or policy)? The Ninth Schedule of the Federal Constitution makes clear that the Federal Government has control over a state’s mineral resources including oil and natural gas.  The state therefore does not have ownership interest in the development of oil and natural gas reserves.  The states of Sabah and Sarawak, however, are permitted to charge import and excise duties on petroleum products as per the 10th Schedule, Part V, Part 1 of the Federal Constitution. 3.5        How does the State derive value from oil and natural gas development (e.g., royalty, share of production, taxes)? Section 4 of the PDA effectively provides for cash payments to be made to the Federal Government or State Governments.  Pursuant to this, in 1976, PETRONAS signed an agreement for payment of a 5% royalty of the revenue to all relevant states in which oil is found. 3.6        Are there any restrictions on the export of production? There are no restrictions on the export of production of oil and natural gas, subject of course to payment of export duties as provided by the Custom Duties Order, 2017. 3.7        Are there any currency exchange restrictions, or restrictions on the transfer of funds derived from production out of the jurisdiction? There are no currency exchange restrictions or restrictions on the transfer of funds derived from production out of the jurisdiction.  All fund transactions are, however, subject to the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act, 2001. 3.8        What restrictions (if any) apply to the transfer or disposal of oil and natural gas development rights or interests? Pursuant to the PDA, all rights relating to the transfer or disposal of oil and natural gas development rest with PETRONAS.  PETRONAS essentially has full monopoly and control over oil and natural gas rights and interests. 3.9        Are participants obliged to provide any security or guarantees in relation to oil and natural gas development? Any security or guarantee requirements are subject to the PSC or RSC terms and conditions entered with PETRONAS. 3.10      Can rights to develop oil and natural gas reserves granted to a participant be pledged for security, or booked for accounting purposes under domestic law? This is again subject to the PSC or RSC terms and conditions entered with PETRONAS.  PETRONAS can grant consent for such rights to be pledged for security or booked for accounting purposes. 3.11      In addition to those rights/authorisations required to explore for and produce oil and natural gas, what other principal Government authorisations are required to develop oil and natural gas reserves (e.g., environmental, occupational health and safety) and from whom are these authorisations to be obtained? There are several pieces of legislation required to be adhered to as already listed above, such as the Environmental Quality Act, 1974 and the Petroleum (Safety Measures) Act, 1984, with powers of authorisation and approval vested in the relevant respective Ministries. 3.12      Is there any legislation or framework relating to the abandonment or decommissioning of physical structures used in oil and natural gas development? If so, what are the principal features/requirements of the legislation? There is no specific legislation or framework relating to the abandonment or decommissioning of physical structures used in oil and natural gas development.  Parties are, however, required to comply with laws relating to environment protection.  In addition to legal compliance, the oil and natural gas industry adopts international guidelines and industry best practices, and complies with relevant international treaties and conventions.  In this regard, strict compliance with the Environmental Quality Act, 1974, the PDA, the Exclusive Economic Zone Act, 1984, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, 1982 (“UNCLOS”) and the International Maritime Organization Guidelines & Standards, 1989. 3.13      Is there any legislation or framework relating to gas storage? If so, what are the principal features/requirements of the legislation? There is no specific legislation or framework relating to gas storage.  All storage, nevertheless, must be approved by the Environmental Department. 3.14      Are there any laws or regulations that deal specifically with the exploration and production of unconventional oil and gas resources? If so, what are their key features? There are no specific laws or regulations that deal with the exploration and production of unconventional oil and gas resources. 3.15      What has been the impact, if any, of the “energy transition” on the oil and gas industry in your jurisdiction, and are there any policies or laws/regulations that require the oil and gas industry to decarbonise? Are there any policies or laws/regulations relating to the development of low-carbon hydrogen and its use in conjunction with or in place of natural gas, or the development of carbon capture and storage? In response to the threats of global warming, Malaysia has adopted the Paris Agreement and committed to a 45% reduction in emissions intensity of GDP by 2030 compared to a 2005 baseline ( [Hyperlink] ). Following the release of the 12th Malaysia Plan in September 2021, the Prime Minister of Malaysia announced a carbon-neutrality target of 2050.  The Government of Malaysia has pledged to no longer build new coal-fired power plants and shall soon introduce a comprehensive National Energy Policy.  Plans to introduce carbon-reduction measures, including carbon pricing and carbon tax, by the end of 2022 after a review of the low-carbon development strategies appear to have been pushed to at the very least 2023.  As of today’s date, no carbon tax bills have been introduced.  Further, while no new coal-fired plants have been built as of the 2021 Plan, the  Government of Malaysia still plans on covering the shortfall of coal through imports from its neighbours. Malaysia primarily uses coal and natural gas to generate electricity.  The installed capacity of coal power plants forms approximately 40% of the total capacity.  In October 2020, PETRONAS set an aspiration to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, partly by making existing operations more efficient, but also by developing low- and zero-carbon fuels and carbon capture technologies ( [Hyperlink] ).  For the full report by KPMG Malaysia, please see [Hyperlink] . 4.1        Outline any regulatory requirements, or specific terms, limitations or rules applying in respect of cross-border sales or deliveries of natural gas (including LNG). Requirements for cross-border sales of natural gas are no different than other commodities that are exported.  The Customs Act, 1976 and its regulations and orders are applicable to cross-border sales and deliveries.  Export duties are generally imposed on Malaysia’s main export commodities. 5.1        Outline any regulatory requirements, or specific terms, limitations or rules applying in respect of cross-border sales or deliveries of oil and oil products. It is the same as for natural gas.  The exportation of certain classes of petroleum products may also require an export licence. 6.1        Outline broadly the ownership, organisational and regulatory framework in relation to transportation pipelines and associated infrastructure (such as natural gas processing and storage facilities). This is under the control of PETRONAS.  Please see the PDA. 6.2        What governmental authorisations (including any applicable environmental authorisations) are required to construct and operate oil and natural gas transportation pipelines and associated infrastructure? This is under the control of PETRONAS.  Please see the PDA. 6.3        In general, how does an entity obtain the necessary land (or other) rights to construct oil and natural gas transportation pipelines or associated infrastructure? Do Government authorities have any powers of compulsory acquisition to facilitate land access? The entity obtains the necessary land rights through direct negotiations with private landowners for the purposes of acquisition or licensing.  Pursuant to the Land Acquisition Act, 1960, the Government of Malaysia is empowered to compulsorily acquire necessary land. 6.4        How is access to oil and natural gas transportation pipelines and associated infrastructure organised? Access to oil and natural gas transportation pipelines and associated infrastructure falls under the purview of and is organised by PETRONAS together with the relevant state’s authority. 6.5        To what degree are oil and natural gas transportation pipelines integrated or interconnected, and how is co-operation between different transportation systems established and regulated? Gas is supplied throughout peninsular Malaysia via an integrated 2,500 km pipeline system, the PGU, built by PETRONAS Gas Bhd (“PGB”) from 1984 to 1998.  A 2,000 km gas distribution pipeline network that utilises gas from the PGU was built by Gas Malaysia Bhd (“GMB”) to cater for small and medium industries, commercial establishments and residential customers.  Further complementing the PGU system is the Natural Gas Distribution System, operated by GMB, that branches off from the PGU at the city gate stations ( [Hyperlink] ). 6.6        Outline any third-party access regime/rights in respect of oil and natural gas transportation and associated infrastructure. For example, can the regulator or a new customer wishing to transport oil or natural gas compel or require the operator/owner of an oil or natural gas transportation pipeline or associated infrastructure to grant capacity or expand its facilities in order to accommodate the new customer? If so, how are the costs (including costs of interconnection, capacity reservation or facility expansions) allocated? The Gas Supply (Amendment) Act, 2016, which amended the GSA, came into force on 16th January 2017 and was specifically targeted to cater for the implementation of the Third-Party Access (“TPA”) system in Malaysia.  This amendment now provides a platform for the entry of new gas suppliers into Malaysia, and the implementation of the TPA system will provide benefits to consumers in the form of competitive gas prices, quality services provided by the relevant service providers, as well as an enhanced sustainability of gas supply. TPA also creates a pathway for third parties to access gas infrastructure for the supply of gas to consumers, which will result in less dependence on PGB and GMB.  The Energy Commission’s Guidelines on Licence Application set out the criteria for involvement in the industry, including becoming licensees, making use of gas infrastructure such as regasification terminals, pipeline transmissions and distribution pipelines to sell gas to consumers (Peninsular Malaysia Gas Industry Outlook, 2019). The amendments empower the Energy Commission with regulatory powers to oversee the implementation of the TPA system, including the powers to issue subsequent codes, guidelines and directions to cover more operational aspects of the TPA system.  Specific information on how costs are allocated is not available. 6.7        Are parties free to agree the terms upon which oil or natural gas is to be transported or are the terms (including costs/tariffs which may be charged) regulated? The Energy Commission’s licence requirements must be met.  Please also see the PDA and GSA. 7.1        Outline broadly the ownership, organisational and regulatory framework in relation to the natural gas transmission/distribution network. The transmission or distribution network of natural gas is vested with PETRONAS or, more specifically, PGB, who is responsible for processing and transmitting gas to the end-user.  The Energy Commission is also involved for all gas supply through pipelines and use thereof. 7.2        What governmental authorisations (including any applicable environmental authorisations) are required to operate a distribution network? The gas distribution network is regulated under the GSA, which not only covers gas supply specifications but practices for safe gas pipeline installation.  A gas utility licence must be obtained from the Energy Commission, without which delivery, transportation, distribution or reticulation of gas through pipelines is not permitted. 7.3        How is access to the natural gas distribution network organised? A gas utility licence must be obtained from the Energy Commission. 7.4        Can the regulator require a distributor to grant capacity or expand its system in order to accommodate new customers? Yes, the Energy Commission established under the Energy Commission Act, 2001 is vested with the power to require a distributor to grant capacity or expand its system to accommodate new customers. 7.5        What fees are charged for accessing the distribution network, and are these fees regulated? The rate of licence fee is as specified in the Third Schedule, Part I of the Gas Supply Regulations, 1997. 7.6        Are there any restrictions or limitations in relation to acquiring an interest in a gas utility, or the transfer of assets forming part of the distribution network (whether directly or indirectly)? Acquiring an interest in a gas utility or the transfer of assets forming part of the distribution network is dependent on approval from the Government of Malaysia. 8.1        Outline broadly the ownership, organisational and regulatory framework in relation to natural gas trading. Please include details of current major initiatives or policies of the Government or regulator (if any) relating to natural gas trading. PETRONAS, through its trading and marketing arm, PETRONAS Energy & Gas Trading Sdn Bhd, controls natural gas trading in Malaysia. 8.2        What range of natural gas commodities can be traded? For example, can only “bundled” products (i.e., the natural gas commodity and the distribution thereof) be traded? A full range of natural gas commodities can be traded. 9.1        Outline broadly the ownership, organisational and regulatory framework in relation to LNG facilities. The PETRONAS LNG Complex is one of the largest LNG production facilities in one location, spread over 276 hectares of land, and is located at Bintulu, Sarawak.  It is controlled by PETRONAS.  Whilst most of its operations are focused around the complex in Bintulu in the state of Sarawak, it has also recently become the world’s first owner and operator of two FLNG facilities. 9.2        What governmental authorisations are required to construct and operate LNG facilities? PETRONAS holds the monopoly to construct and operate LNG facilities.  A licence must be obtained from PETRONAS pursuant to the Petroleum Regulations, 1974 before any construction and operation of LNG facilities by a third party is permitted.  A contractor wishing to participate in exploration and production activities must apply and receive a licence from MPM. 9.3        Is there any regulation of the price or terms of service in the LNG sector? The Ministry of Domestic Trade, Co-operatives and Consumerism regulates the prices and terms of service of the LNG sector pursuant to the Price Control and Anti-Profiteering Act, 2011. 9.4        Outline any third-party access regime/rights in respect of LNG facilities. Pursuant to Section 6(1) of the PDA, notwithstanding the provisions of any other written law, no business of processing or refining of petroleum or manufacturing of petrochemical products from petroleum may be carried out by any person other than PETRONAS unless there is, in respect of any such business, permission given by the Prime Minister of Malaysia. 10.1      Outline broadly the regulatory framework in relation to the downstream oil sector. Amendments to the Petroleum Regulations, 1974 in January 1991 resulted in MDTCA and MITI taking responsibility for regulating activities in the downstream sector.  MDTCA issues licences for marketing and distribution of oil products, whereas MITI issues licences for the processing and refining of oil and the manufacture of petrochemical products. 10.2      Outline broadly the ownership, organisation and regulatory framework in relation to oil trading. Again, this is controlled by PETRONAS.  PETCO Trading Labuan Company Ltd is PETRONAS’s global trading arm for crude oil and petroleum products. 11.1      Which governmental authority or authorities are responsible for the regulation of competition aspects, or anti-competitive practices, in the oil and natural gas sector? The Competition Act, 2010 prohibits anti-competitive agreements and the abuse of dominant positions in the market.  The Act has been in force since 1st January 2012.  However, pursuant to the First Schedule of the Act, commercial activities regulated under, inter alia, the following pieces of legislation are excluded: The Energy Commission is, however, charged with safeguarding fair and efficient market conduct or, in the absence of a competitive market, preventing the misuse of monopoly or market power in respect of the generation, production, transmission, distribution and supply of electricity and the supply of gas through pipelines.  The Competition Commission, which enforces the Competition Act, 2010, monitors and acts on anti-competitive practices in connection with midstream and downstream activities. 11.2      To what criteria does the regulator have regard in determining whether conduct is anti-competitive? As there are no specific laws regulating anti-competition in the oil and natural gas sector, the Energy Commission will determine whether conduct is deemed anti-competitive. 11.3      What power or authority does the regulator have to preclude or take action in relation to anti-competitive practices? There are no laws on this in relation to the oil and natural gas sector.  However, as a gas utility licence must be obtained from the Energy Commission, a licence may be refused for parties known to engage in anti-competitive practices as seen by the Energy Commission. 11.4      Does the regulator (or any other Government authority) have the power to approve/disapprove mergers or other changes in control over businesses in the oil and natural gas sector, or proposed acquisitions of development assets, transportation or associated infrastructure or distribution assets? If so, what criteria and procedures are applied? How long does it typically take to obtain a decision approving or disapproving the transaction? There are no specific laws or regulations relating to mergers and acquisitions of oil and gas companies in Malaysia.  Both private and public merger and acquisition transactions are generally governed under the Companies Act, 2016. 12.1      Are there any special requirements or limitations on acquisitions of interests in the natural gas sector (whether development, transportation or associated infrastructure, distribution or other) by foreign companies? An apparent theme of this chapter reveals that PETRONAS has exclusive control over the oil and natural gas industry.  In this regard, and unless special approval is obtained from the Prime Minister of Malaysia pursuant to Section 6 of the PDA, a foreign company can only participate in the natural gas sector either appointing a local company that meets all the above requirements as an agent to serve as a local representative and service provider or by forming a joint venture company with a local company or individual that, again, complies with all requirements.  Hefty fines are imposable for offences against this requirement. 12.2      To what extent is regulatory policy in respect of the oil and natural gas sector influenced or affected by international treaties or other multinational arrangements? Malaysia has signed numerous international treaties relevant to the oil and natural gas sector, including the: London Convention, 1996; Geneva Convention on the Continental Shelf, 1958; UNCLOS; International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 and its Protocol; International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation, 1990; International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, 1992; and the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, 1992. Given Malaysia’s reliance on international trade, Malaysia puts a high emphasis on regional and bilateral trade agreements.  Malaysia joined the General Agreement on Trade and Tariff (“GATT”) in 1957, and was therefore a founding member of the World Trade Organization, which replaced the GATT.  Malaysia has 54 bilateral investment treaties in force, which typically include clauses for fair and equitable treatment and broad guarantees of protection for investors.  Malaysia is also a member of the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers, which is the petroleum industry’s global forum in which members identify and share best practices to achieve improvements in health, safety, the environment, security, social responsibility, engineering and operations. 13.1      Provide a brief overview of compulsory dispute resolution procedures (statutory or otherwise) applying to the oil and natural gas sector (if any), including procedures applying in the context of disputes between the applicable Government authority/regulator and: participants in relation to oil and natural gas development; transportation pipeline and associated infrastructure owners or users in relation to the transportation, processing or storage of natural gas; downstream oil infrastructure owners or users; and distribution network owners or users in relation to the distribution/transmission of natural gas. Generally, a dispute may be resolved by commencing a civil action in the courts.  The level of court, Magistrates, Sessions or High Court depends on the quantum of the claim and/or the type of relief sought.  However, arbitration, which is regulated by the Arbitration Act, 2005, stands as the more common dispute resolution method in the oil and natural gas industry due to common inclusion of an arbitration agreement clause in contracts.  PETRONAS contracts more often than not, if not always, contain an arbitration agreement clause.  Unless such arbitration agreement clause specifically refers to the type of rules to be employed for conduct of the arbitration, the Arbitration Act, 2005 and the Asian International Arbitration Centre (“AIAC”) (formerly KLRCA) Rules, which have consolidated into their main body the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, 2013, as commonly applied in Malaysia, will apply.  Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the Director of the AIAC shall appoint the arbitral tribunal.  Foreign arbitrations (where at least one party is a foreign entity) require the appointment of three arbitrators, with each party nominating one arbitrator each and the two nominated arbitrators appointing the Chairman. 13.2      Is your jurisdiction a signatory to, and has it duly ratified into domestic legislation: the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards; and/or the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (“ICSID”)? Malaysia has ratified both the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (“New York Convention”) and the ICSID.  The former came into force on 3rd February 1986 and Malaysia joined the latter on 14th October 1966. 13.3      Is there any special difficulty (whether as a matter of law or practice) in litigating, or seeking to enforce judgments or awards, against Government authorities or State organs (including any immunity)? Generally, no.  There are no special difficulties in initiating litigation against Government or State authorities.  In terms of registering a foreign judgment, the Reciprocal Enforcement of Judgments Act, 1958 is a specific statute enacted to provide the mechanism for how such judgments can be enforced in Malaysia.  The reciprocating countries as identified in the Act are Brunei, Hong Kong, India, New Zealand, the Republic of Sri Lanka, Singapore and the United Kingdom, but this is limited to Supreme Court judgments only.  Arbitration awards, however, receive much wider recognition as a result of the Arbitration Act, 2005.  Section 38 of the Act provides a summary procedure for recognition and enforcement of awards that is applicable to both awards where the seat of arbitration is in Malaysia and to foreign awards sought to be enforced in Malaysia.  Foreign awards refer to awards from a state that is party to the New York Convention. On written application to the High Court, an award made in respect of an arbitration where the seat of arbitration is in Malaysia or an award from a foreign state shall, subject to Sections 38 and 39 of the Arbitration Act, 2005, be recognised as binding and be enforced by entry as a judgment in terms of the award or by action.  A “foreign state” in this context refers to a state that is party to the New York Convention (Section 38(4) of the Act). The mandatory nature of Section 38 of the Arbitration Act, 2005 limits the court’s discretion in refusing to recognise and enforce an award when the formal requirements of the Act have been satisfied.  The grounds for refusal to recognise an award are contained in Section 39 of the Act. 13.4      Have there been instances in the oil and natural gas sector when foreign corporations have successfully obtained judgments or awards against Government authorities or State organs pursuant to litigation before domestic courts? As PETRONAS holds the exclusive rights in the oil and natural gas sector, Government authorities or State organs are generally not subject to litigation vis-à-vis oil and natural gas disputes.  Disputes would, in any event, be subjected to arbitration proceedings, which are private and confidential in nature. 14.1      Have there been any new regulatory or policy initiatives in your jurisdiction directly in response to the recent rise in global oil and gas prices (such as price caps, subsidies or a new focus on local sources of energy)? In order to combat the rising inflation in oil and gas prices, the Government of Malaysia has, as of August 2022, provided fuel and energy subsidies of over RM31 billion.  To place this into perspective for the readers, the overall fuel and energy subsidies for 2021 were only RM11 billion, slightly more than a third of 2022.  These subsidies go towards a continuing cap on the prices of petrol and diesel, with petrol prices capped at RM2.05/l for RON 95 and RM2.15/l for diesel. 14.2      Please provide, in no more than 300 words, a summary of any new cases, trends and developments in Oil and Gas Regulation Law in your jurisdiction (other than anything already discussed above). As the reader will be aware, PETRONAS has exclusive rights to oil and natural gas exploration and development in Malaysia, but is required to make cash payments to the Federal Government and relevant states. However, in an unprecedented move and pursuant to the State Sale Tax (Taxable Goods and Rate of Tax) (Amendment) (No. 2) Order, 2018, the Government of Sarawak started imposing an additional sales tax of 5% “for sale or delivery to any person outside the state of Sarawak” on petroleum products specified therein, effective from 1st January 2019. PETRONAS filed a judicial review application against the State Comptroller, challenging the State’s right to impose the sales tax on its petroleum-related products assessed in excess of RM1.3 billion.  PETRONAS sought declarations that the Government of Sarawak is not entitled to impose state sales tax on petroleum products. However, the Kuching High Court decision on 13th March 2020 dismissed the judicial review application to challenge the sales tax imposed by Sarawak, resulting in the State being entitled to collect said sales tax.  The High Court decision can be found in PETRONAS v Comptroller of State Sales Tax, Sarawak & Ors [2021] 9 MLJ 801.  The effect of this decision on the neighbouring state, Sabah, is yet to be seen. PETRONAS, who appealed the decision, had subsequently withdrawn the same against the Government of Sarawak.  This precedent will, in time, certainly raise questions about PETRONAS’s future control over Malaysia’s oil and natural gas assets under the PDA.

ISEAS Perspective 2022/21, 2 March 2022 Download PDF Version  Since the oil and gas (O&G) sector’s take-off in the 1970s, this natural bounty has yielded myriad benefits to Malaysia. While not falling into the ‘resource curse’ of an unquestioned reliance on natural resources, the O&G sector is nonetheless a key enabler for many aspects of the country’s economy and public finances. Malaysia’s current account shows the significance of the sector, which has long accounted for a sizable proportion of merchandise exports and foreign exchange earnings. In 1990, for instance, the country’s global exports of fuel and derived products totalled US$5.4 billion and made up 18.3 per cent of all merchandise exports. In 2019, just before the COVID crisis struck, the corresponding figures were US$34.5 billion and 14.5 per cent.[1] Beyond those in the country’s ledgers, indications of the O&G sector’s skyrocketing success are everywhere – most visibly in the country’s much-vaunted infrastructure. Examples include but are not limited to: the Petronas Towers, the erstwhile tallest buildings in the world and centrepiece of Kuala Lumpur’s skyline; Putrajaya, the country’s administrative capital; and the Kuala Lumpur International Airport.[2] The sector has also underpinned many of Malaysia’s economic nationalist aspirations. Today, the government-owned corporate giant, Petronas, is a source of pride and, in 2021, was the nation’s sole Fortune Global 500 company. The government has also sought to foster an eco-system of local firms in the O&G sector to diversify the economy and foster more technologically-intensive tasks. And, when demand calls, it has used the country’s national flagship firm to bail out capsizing corporate captains. However, there are growing signs that, going forward, the sector will no longer be able to play such an outsized role. One statistic suffices to illustrate this trend. In 2009, as much as 40 per cent of government revenue was derived from O&G-related sources; in 2021, however, the corresponding figure had plummeted to a mere 19.2 per cent.[3] Despite the O&G segment’s prodigious potential, it faces a number of structural constraints and policy challenges. In order to analyse these, this paper will first set out the historical development of the sector and the Malaysian government’s long-term policy objectives. The subsequent sections will look at the key challenges facing the sector and then conclude.  Malaysia’s tryst with oil and gas began more than a hundred years ago, when Shell discovered the first oil well in Sarawak in 1910. However, in the following decades, production remained limited. This was because drilling for oil was not particularly lucrative, given the offshore location of many of the country’s oil deposits and relatively low international prices for the commodity. However, technological improvements in the early 1960s led to the discovery of many more oil fields in Sarawak, which piqued the interest of major foreign players such as Shell, Esso, and Conoco. Under the Continental Shelf Act of 1966, these companies were allowed to operate concessions in return for royalties and tax payments.[4] These arrangements changed radically in the 1970s. The 1973 Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Oil Crisis underscored the importance of sovereign control over energy resources, whilst highlighting their revenue-earning potential. This, coupled with growing economic nationalism in Malaysia, led the government to secure greater control over the O&G sector and renegotiate production agreements with the international oil majors.[5] The drive was also influenced by the country’s National Economic Policy (NEP) of 1971, which proposed 30 per cent ownership of corporate wealth by indigenous groups to encourage their equitable participation in commerce.[6] The dynamic local and global O&G landscape led to the formulation of the Petroleum Development Act (PDA) in 1974, which bestowed the central government with formidable authority and laid out the regulatory framework for the sector. This was followed by the establishment of Malaysia’s national oil company, Petroliam Nasional Berhad (Petronas).[7] The entity was incorporated as a private company wholly-owned by the Malaysian government, holding exclusive rights of the ownership, exploration, and exploitation of oil and gas in the country. [8] Petronas answers directly to the Prime Minister.[9] Petronas then renegotiated the leases granted to international firms operating in Malaysia with production-sharing contracts (PSCs). In 1976, the company went downstream for the first time and Malaysia became a net exporter of oil, reinforcing the enterprise’s primary objective, national self-reliance. During the worldwide oil glut of the 1980s, the government was forced to increase production and relax the conditions for joint ventures between Petronas and other global oil companies. Over this period, the state-owned giant also forayed into refining and distribution.[10] The discovery of additional oil fields and the completion of the Petronas LNG complex helped the firm secure a comfortable spot in the Fortune Global 500 list.[11] Throughout the 1990s, Petronas, in an attempt to establish its presence beyond Malaysian shores, began making inroad investments in emerging ASEAN economies, including Myanmar, Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Escalating its diversification efforts, the company ventured into the aromatics industry, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) distribution, polyethylene production, ship-owning, and the development of the Kuala Lumpur City Centre. At the turn of the century, Petronas further boosted its internationalisation strategy, forming significant upstream and downstream sector agreements with countries in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, and Asia. The firm also initiated risk-sharing service contracts to develop Malaysia’s marginal oil and fields and began consolidating the national petroleum industry to mitigate the impact of global oil price fluctuations.[12]  The goals for the O&G sector were laid out in the 1974 PDA, which were to: Over the decades, subsequent plans such as the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Industrial Master Plans, the 2010 Economic Transformation Programme, and sector specific initiatives have all retained these themes, namely enabling the sector to grow, retaining ownership control over key aspects of the production process, promoting more capital- and skill-intensive activities, and fostering domestic entrepreneurship. More recent plans also maintain these objectives in light of new developments. For example, the National OGSE Industry Blueprint 2021-2030 seeks to create a ‘robust, resilient, and globally-competitive’ Malaysian oil and gas, services and equipment (OGSE) sector that can improve national GDP growth, sector employment, export development, and fiscal contribution. Its successful implementation is anticipated to significantly ramp up the sector’s contribution to national GDP by the end of the decade. In order to do so, the masterplan emphasises the need to consolidate the industry, simplify licensing schemes, and set up multiple research and development (R&D) centres throughout Malaysia.[14] In the same vein, Petronas’ 2022–2024 Industry Activity Outlook report underscores the urgency of the oil and gas sector to expedite the energy transition process in the face of growing global resistance to traditional oil and gas businesses. The document anticipates a very gradual and fragile recovery from the COVID-induced economic slowdown and, therefore, draws attention to cost-effective innovations being readied to be employed throughout the sector. Its key targets include: promoting renewable energy opportunities among OGSE players; supporting Petronas Ventures, the firm’s venture capital arm, in driving technological change; and using efficiency as a tool to maximise assets and improve operations to maintain a competitive edge over regional players.[15]  Today, Malaysia is the second-largest oil producer in Southeast Asia and the world’s third largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG). At the end of 2020, the country held proved oil reserves of 2.7 billion barrels and natural gas deposits totalling 32.1 trillion cubic feet.[16] Figure 1 depicts a snapshot of the country’s oil and gas reserves, located mainly offshore in the South China Sea, near the coasts of the states of Kelantan, Terengganu, Sarawak, and Sabah. Since its inception, Petronas has held exclusive ownership rights over all oil and natural gas exploration and production activities in the country. Among the prominent international oil production companies currently operating in Malaysia are Shell, ExxonMobil, and ConocoPhillips. According to data compiled by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), in 2020, the country’s total liquid fuel production was close to 655,000 barrels per day (b/d), of which about 556,000 b/d was estimated to be crude oil and 49,000 b/d was natural gas plant liquids (NGPL).[17] Contribution to Exports Since the 1970s, and especially after the formation of Petronas, Malaysia’s fuel exports – as a percentage of total merchandise exports – have remained fairly steady. This has formed a key part of Malaysia’s export basket and has constituted a reliable source of foreign exchange. However, fuel exports have dipped during times of oil price slumps due to unfavourable external conditions (Figure 2). For instance, sharp drops were observed during the mid-1980s oil glut, the 1997-98 Asian Financial Crisis (AFC), the 2014-16 oil price crash, and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. Fiscal Contribution In addition to the oil and gas sector being an important growth driver of the national economy, it is a vital source of revenue for the government. This fiscal contribution comes in a variety of forms, which are: Tables 1a and 1b present the changing composition of oil and gas revenue over the past 50 years. The first three revenue sources are long-standing. However, since the mid-1980s, Petronas has paid dividends to the Malaysian government. From around 15 per cent in 1985, this has increased to approximately half of the total of petroleum-related revenue in recent years. Consequently, the relative importance of established contributions such as the Petroleum Income Tax and Petroleum and Gas Royalty have decreased in relative importance, and the more variable – and more discretionary – Petronas Dividend has become the largest source of oil-related revenue over time. Domestic Entrepreneurship The rapid rise of Petronas over the past half-century has solidified the firm’s position as a key pillar of the Malaysian economy, expanding its reach beyond Malaysia and allowing it to emerge as the nation’s sole Fortune Global 500 company. For the first three quarters of 2021, the 48,679-employee-strong corporation’s total assets were valued at RM618.9 billion, total revenue stood at RM171.4 billion, profit after tax reached RM35.2 billion, and capital investments amounted to RM20.4 billion.[20] Supportive policy frameworks implemented over the decades have led to the advent and growth of a large number of firms within the sector. Thus, in both upstream and downstream activities, Malaysia’s home-grown companies have, to a large extent, been shielded from foreign competitors. For instance, to participate in exploration and production activities, foreign companies must receive a licence from Petronas. Likewise, there are substantial local or Bumiputera equity conditions for companies interested in supplying O&G-related goods and services. Keen foreign firms can do so only through an agency agreement with domestic companies licensed by Petronas, or by forming a joint venture with a local company/individual.[21] When it comes to participating in refining and manufacturing activities, a foreign company is required to set up a local subsidiary and comply with the conditions set by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Exclusive Economic Zone Act 1984).[22] At present, Malaysia is home to approximately 4,000 O&G businesses, including domestic and international oil companies, independents, and services and manufacturing firms. This has facilitated the formation of an extensive network of Machinery and Equipment (M&E) manufacturers that supports key strategic segments such as marine, drilling, engineering, fabrication, offshore installation, and operations and maintenance (O&M). Collectively, they provide employment to an estimated 59,000 individuals across upstream, midstream and downstream activities in the O&G value chain (Table 2).[23]  While the O&G sector, together with its substantial derivatives, has undeniably benefited Malaysia, going forward, there are considerable challenges facing it. The first concerns the overall contribution of the sector to the country’s economy. The proportion of Malaysia’s fuel exports has remained quite stable for a long time and, in fact, the absolute value of crude oil exported has been going up in recent years. However, the inescapable reality is that the O&G sector’s importance relative to the size of the Malaysian economy has taken a hit as the latter has grown consistently and rapidly. Indeed, in the late 1970s, rents derived from the sector contributed to more than 10 per cent of GDP, but recent numbers are noticeably smaller, hovering around 2 per cent since 2015 (Figure 3). The second, more complex challenge relates to the sector’s inconsistent fiscal contribution. Oil prices are influenced by a host of supply, demand and public policy factors – ranging from conventional output decisions made by OPEC or private oil-producing nations to central bank interest rates, or disruptions brought about by natural calamities or political unrest. The global experience over the past two years has shown that unforeseen economic and health crises can contribute to the variability, too. The problem is further compounded by the cyclicality inherent in oil price movements. The volatility of oil prices significantly affects the government’s fiscal revenue, with price rises adding to the public purse and price crashes depleting it. This fluctuation can be clearly seen in the varying proportion of the revenue derived from the oil and gas sector in Malaysia’s total government revenue (Table 3). Finally, it must be recognised that Malaysia’s hydrocarbon resources are not unlimited. The production capacity of the O&G sector in the nation has been on a downward trajectory for some time now, thanks to maturing large fields. In 2016, total fuel production was 757,000 b/d, while in 2020, this statistic had gone down to 655,000 b/d.[24] In fact, several studies have tried to determine the precise number of years of oil reserves left in Malaysia. A 2016 estimate claimed that, without net exports, the country would have just enough reserves to last until 2030.[25] This claim was reinforced in 2019, when the Economic Affairs Ministry announced in parliament that local oil and gas fields were expected to be depleted by 2029.[26] A slightly more optimistic image emerged in 2021, as Petronas records indicated that the national oil reserves would last for 28 years – and 38 if contingent resources are accounted for.[27]  The abovementioned challenges, along with the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, do not bode well for the state-owned entity’s growth prospects. Petronas’ Continued Financial Viability A major impediment to the sustained growth of the O&G sector arises from Petronas’ inability to continually contribute large sums of money to the government while simultaneously generating profits, exploring new oil fields, and investing in innovation. A large chunk of the corporation’s revenue is directed towards public revenue – both during oil price surges and drops. In fact, Petronas has periodically had to make contributions to the state coffers for a range of reasons, including bailing out government linked corporations (GLCs) in the 1980s, nationalising ailing firms following the Asian Financial Crisis, and shoring up the former state-owned automotive producer Proton.[28] More recently, for each of the past three years, Petronas has provided additional dividend payments to the government, first to counterbalance the phasing out of the goods and services tax (GST) in 2019, and then in light of the COVID pandemic in 2020 and 2021.[29] For example, the 2020 additional payment amounted to RM10 billion, on top of the committed RM24 billion – and in a year when the firm itself faced huge losses.[30] There have been constant calls to cap the amount of Petronas’ dividend at a set percentage of the company’s profit, but this has yet to be implemented. This perennial pressure for cash transfers has, on occasion, led to disagreements between Petronas leaders and Malaysia’s elected leadership. However, given the direct relationship between the Prime Minister and the corporation’s CEO, dissenting directors do not retain their position for long.[31] Complicating the firm’s financial viability is the fact that it also needs to keep on investing in technology and securing additional deposits overseas. To this end, in recent years the corporation has invested in research and operations in such locations as Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Vietnam, and Japan.[32] Moreover, once crude oil production in Malaysia peaks and demand reaches a ceiling, which is expected to take place in 2025, Petronas will be forced to embrace cleaner energy alternatives and make a greater commitment to decarbonisation and sustainability.[33] The shift away from fossil fuels will undoubtedly be accompanied by asset divestments and acquisition of new businesses, both of which could limit the company’s earnings – at least in the short run.[34] Protection from International Competition The government’s push to prioritise local entrepreneurs does not come without its share of costs. The reduced level of competition for domestic players has, many a time, manifested itself in the form of complacent policies and inefficient performance. A series of recent highly publicised incidents have highlighted the growing incidence of uncompetitive behaviour among local OGSE firms. For example, in December 2021, Serba Dinamik Holdings’ CEO was charged with submitting what the regulator said was a false statement to the stock exchange.[35] In March 2021, Petronas, after receiving adverse reports on alleged unethical and integrity issues, suspended its 60 per cent-owned subsidiary, Deleum Primera Sdn Bhd, from participating in the national oil company’s tenders and contracts until further notice.[36] In July 2019, the operating licence for Barakah Offshore Petroleum Bhd’s wholly owned unit, PBJV Group Sdn Bhd was suspended by Petronas due to reported non-performance.[37] It is not just the smaller firms that have faltered. Petronas, too, recently found itself in hot water when several local vendors accused the GLC of delaying their payments[38]. Late last year, after the military coup in Sudan, that nation’s transitional government issued arrest warrants against Petronas’ country manager and other officers. Sudan’s military leader General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan alleged that the company had acquired its local assets through illegal means during the rule of ousted leader Omar al-Bashir.[39] In this regard, one cannot ignore the fact that, despite being Malaysia’s only Fortune 500 company since 1997, the company has of late had a hard time retaining its rank in the double digits. Figure 4 shows that the state-owned enterprise’s position has been slipping for a few years now – nosediving from the 68th spot in 2015 to the 277th position in 2021.[40] This trend suggests that Petronas’ survival in the increasingly competitive global economy hinges on retaining a larger portion of its revenue for reinvestments.  The oil and gas sector is vital for Malaysia’s economy. Beyond the overall contribution to GDP, the sector has been harnessed very effectively for the country’s long-term economic development, most notably through its contribution to state coffers but also through promoting domestic entrepreneurship in the upstream, midstream, and downstream activities. However, as the Malaysian economy expands, its growth rate outpaces the feasible growth of the sector, which becomes smaller in proportional terms. This, along with potentially dwindling oil reserves, volatility of oil prices, and a general decline of the fossil fuel industry, means that it cannot be the bedrock of public finances that it was in the past. Soon, the possibilities of turning to Petronas for exceptional transfers of a meaningful dimension will be limited. This, in addition to the need for the GLC to ensure its own commercial viability, suggests that the Malaysian state will need to look at new sources of fiscal revenue and also consider increasing the competition for local players in the O&G sector. Like all non-renewables, stocks of this precious resource are finite.

[6] It is, however, important to note that the appetite for increased assertion over the national economy and its resources was not exclusive to Malaysia. A number of oil-rich countries including Iran, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Indonesia were also curtailing the activities of foreign enterprises while enhancing domestic capabilities (Yacob 2021; Endnote 5).

Gale (1981; Endnote 5) also contains detailed information on the negotiations between Petronas and international oil producers. [8] The 1957 Constitution established that the management of natural resources was the preserve of state governments, as opposed to the federal government. The PDA centralized a great deal of control over oil. This did not go uncontested by states reluctant to lose control over revenue from this source. The PDA does provide for some element of revenue sharing between the central and state governments, however this issue is not yet completely resolved.

Former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has supported the direct reporting structure to the Prime Minister on the grounds that it makes decision making easier and avoids interference by political parties. Other proposals include making Petronas a publicly-listed corporation with its accounts discussed in parliament.

"Petronas also aims to expand its overseas gas portfolio to 700,000boepd by 2024, according to top executives.","Malaysian state-owned energy company Petronas expects its domestic oil and gas production to peak at approximately two million barrels of oil equivalent (boepd) per day by 2024, Reuters reports. Around 60–70% of the company’s total production is gas. Executive vice-president and CEO of Petronas’ upstream business Adif Zulkifli said at the Energy Asia conference on Tuesday that this quantity of gas production will remain the same going forward.  The gold standard of business intelligence.

Senior vice-president of upstream business at Malaysia Petroleum Management Mohamad Firouz Asnan added that Petronas also aims to expand its overseas gas portfolio to 700,000boepd by 2024. The company hopes to ramp up output from its liquid natural gas (LNG) project in Canada. Petronas owns 25% of the project located in Kitimat, British Columbia, which produces 14 million tonnes per year of LNG. Mohamad said the combined 2.7 million barrels of oil equivalent of domestic and overseas oil and gas production is expected to remain steady through the decade until 2030. Last year, Petronas recorded an average total production of 2.4 million barrels of oil equivalent, according to its fourth-quarter earnings report published in December.
