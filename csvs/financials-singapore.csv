The next wave of Finance: Singapore’s growing Fintech market,"With global cumulative investment in financial technology (fintech) forecast to exceed US$150 billion in three to five years, economies around the world are vying to attract fintech innovators and cash in on this growing industry. Singapore, too, has thrown down the gauntlet, with increasingly progressive regulations that encourage testing and collaboration.
Singapore’s thriving fintech ecosystem is a clear contender in the race for fintech dollars. A recent Deloitte report scored the city-state’s fintech hub highest, tied with London, after evaluating 21 of the world’s top global fintech hubs.
 Why Singapore is built for fintech
Fintech innovators are drawn to Singapore for many obvious reasons. The island state is a renowned financial centre with world-class infrastructure and connectivity. Ultra-high-speed fibre infrastructure runs across the nation, while mobile subscription penetration exceeds 100 per cent – factors that are all key for fintech growth.
Singapore is also located among the fast-growing financial markets in Southeast Asia, making it an ideal test bed for fintech innovators looking to tap regional opportunities. While 96 per cent of Singaporeans have bank accounts, around 59 per cent of the adult population in East Asia and Southeast Asia remain unbanked, according to McKinsey & Company.
Deloitte scored Singapore highly for its business friendly environment, access to expertise, strong government support, and excellent regulations that encourage innovation. Singapore’s approach is especially refreshing given that regulation is a notorious obstacle for fintech globally.
In August 2015, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) established the FinTech & Innovation Group within its organisation structure to regulate fintech. But its most exciting move to date is releasing proposed guidelines in June 2016 for a ‘regulatory sandbox’ for fintech experiments. This is meant to relax regulations to allow financial institutions and non-financial players to experiment and test fintech products on customers within a well-defined space and duration. It would both allow failure – the lifeblood of innovation – and limit consequences. Two months later, MAS also released a payments roadmap to encourage the universal adoption of electronic and innovative payments, among other goals, while addressing risks such as cybersecurity.
In addition, Singapore has put its money where its mouth is. Last year, MAS announced that it would allocate S$225 million (US$162 million) to a five-year Financial Sector Technology & Innovation scheme to fund innovation centres, innovative solutions by financial institutions and industry-wide projects such as the building of technology infrastructure. Many major institutions have already jumped at the opportunity, including DBS, Citibank, Credit Suisse, MetLife and UBS. MAS also nurtures innovation among new ventures by lending support to fintech accelerators such as Startupbootcamp Fintech Singapore while UOB has partnered with the Infocomm Development Authority to set up the startup accelerator FinLab.
Private sector funding is further fuelling the fintech ecosystem, with venture capitalists, angel and private equity funds pumping in money. IncubAsia Ventures is but one VC, which invests in early stage fintech startups. Life.Sreda is another fintech investor, which relocated from Russia to seize on opportunities in Singapore’s booming fintech market.
Collaboration is crucial to any fintech ecosystem, and Singapore offers an ideal ground for this to flourish. Startups can access capital and customer bases, while incumbents can tap the talent and agility of new ventures.
For example, the inaugural Singapore FinTech Festival in November offers a single platform that aims to spark co-creations. Established financial services groups are also keen on collaborating through their labs. To that end, OCBC Bank recently set up The Open Vault at OCBC, a new fintech unit that aims to ”leverage the creativity and nimbleness of fintech startups”.
 Mature mobile and digital payments
Based on the current landscape, mobile and digital payments are likely the most mature fintech solutions. Singapore is home to a host of startups that operate in that space including goSwiff, Kashmi and 2C2P. Banks have also launched e-wallets such as DBS PayLah!, UOB Mobile Cash and OCBC Pay Anyone.
After the 2014 launch of FAST, an electronic funds transfer service enabling 24/7 real-time transactions across 19 banks, Singapore’s payments scene also accelerated. While utilisation of mobile devices for payments remains small, there is no doubt that it is on the rise – increasing 42 per cent from 2013 to 2016. The fact that KPMG found that most consumers believe mobile devices and wearables will ”quite likely” replace physical payment cards is another positive sign.
In the Singapore Payments Roadmap report, KPMG made recommendations to speed up the evolution and efficiency of the country’s payments ecosystem, including focusing on strategic infrastructure projects, streamlining and strengthening the regulatory framework, and establishing a new governance model for payments.
 The future of safeguarding fintech
In step with the fintech boom, safeguarding fintech use is an escalating priority. It’s also an area poised for sweeping change.
In recent years, banks have secured customer transactions with two-factor authentication solutions that deliver One Time Passwords via SMS or hardware token. These hardware tokens are now approaching the end of their lifecycle – they only last around five years.
At the same time, there are growing concerns over SMS authentication. The severity of fraud and cybersecurity incidents due to SMS insecurity has reached a point where even the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has written formal guidelines advising against the use of SMS as a delivery method for second-factor authentication OTPs.
It comes as little surprise that Singapore is now seeing banks look for alternative methods of two-factor authentication – not only due to security concerns around SMS, but also because of the expense of maintaining and renewing hardware.
One alternative is a soft token, such as V-Key’s V-OS mobile SDK – a virtual smart card embedded inside an Android or iOS mobile banking app that can simplify the OTP generation and input process to a single button press, making it both more secure and convenient.
At the same time, banks are also looking to leapfrog two-factor authentication entirely with biometrics, which verifies a person’s identity against physical or behavioral characteristics. Solutions like V-OS can enable biometric verification in a mobile app, without relying on specialised hardware. Citibank and OCBC have already introduced biometrics, while DBS plans to roll out their own solution by year-end.
 Winning the fintech race
With its attractive fundamentals and progressive government support, Singapore is clearly on track to cement its place as the leading fintech ecosystem in Southeast Asia. But the real winners in the race for fintech dollars will be those who not only prioritise fintech solutions and security, but also go further – looking past technological innovations and efficiency to deliver tangible benefits for end-users. For the true power of fintech lies in how it can deliver a great user experience, going beyond transactions to make life more convenient and even anticipate our needs.",v-key

Total outstanding debt arranged by financial institutions in Singapore down 2% in 2022: MAS,"SINGAPORE - The total outstanding debt arranged by financial institutions in Singapore stood at $512 billion at the end of 2022, down 2 per cent from $523 billion in 2021, as major central banks raised interest rates to rein in inflation.
New debt issuances tumbled 18 per cent to $190 billion in 2022 from $232 billion in 2021, according to the Singapore Corporate Debt Market Development Report 2023 released by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) on Monday.
In Asia excluding Japan, the issuance volume of G-3 bonds – which represent bonds denominated in US dollars, yen or euros – halved to US$192 billion (S$263 billion) from US$391 billion in 2021.
The US dollar was the most favoured currency for corporate debt issuances in Singapore in 2022, accounting for 73.4 per cent of the currency denominations.
This was followed by the Singapore dollar at 15.3 per cent, the euro and the Hong Kong dollar at 2.6 per cent each, and the Australian dollar at 2.5 per cent.
Financial institutions were the key issuers in 2022. This was driven by banks’ funding activity to strengthen capital buffers in anticipation of further interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve.
Their share of Singapore dollar issuances stood at 44.3 per cent. Statutory boards accounted for 28.1 per cent of the share of Singapore-dollar issuances, corporates excluding properties and special purpose vehicles at 10.7 per cent each, and property firms at 6.2 per cent.

Financial institutions accounted for 83.9 per cent of the non-Singapore dollar issuances. Corporations excluding property comprised 10.8 per cent, special purpose vehicles 4.7 per cent, supranational 0.3 per cent and property 0.3 per cent.
“Financial institutions continued to tap our multi-currency bond market and raised funding in various currencies such as the US dollar, Australian dollar, yuan, Hong Kong dollar and euro in anticipation that funding costs were likely to rise further in the near term,” MAS said. 
On the other hand, the number of corporate issuers halved in 2022, as those with strong balance sheets cut back on fund-raising efforts as borrowing costs increased.
Issuance of green, social, sustainability, sustainability-linked and transition bonds (GSS+) in Singapore fell to $10.1 billion in 2022 from $14.4 billion in 2021. However, this remained higher than the $8.6 billion worth of issuances for 2019 and 2020 combined, signalling “a continuing mainstreaming” of GSS+ bonds, MAS said.
In 2022, the Housing Board, National Environment Agency and national water agency PUB raised a total of $8.2 billion, half of which were green bonds.
The financial regulator said public sector green bond issuances are a key part of Singapore’s sustainability strategy and its efforts to develop the country as a green finance hub in Asia.
“These issuances spur the development of a high-quality green bond market in Singapore by serving as a reference for the corporate green bond market, deepening market liquidity for green bonds, attracting green issuers, capital, and investors,” MAS said.
The Singapore Government issued its inaugural $2.4 billion sovereign green bond in August 2022. Proceeds from the 50-year bond were used to fund the Cross Island Line and Jurong Region Line.
Real estate investment trusts, such as First Reit, Ascendas Reit and Ascott Reit, issued a total of $500 million of social, green and sustainability-linked bonds in 2022 as well.
Also of note was an offshore US$500 million green bond issued by the Singapore branch of Bank of China in April 2022 as part of its sustainability series of bonds issued in various jurisdictions. The proceeds were used to fund electrified metro projects and green building projects.
MAS said global financial conditions continued to be less accommodative, with interest rates expected to remain higher for longer in 2023.
It said that Asian bond markets would be driven by the refinancing needs of corporate issuers as interest rate conditions stabilise and, over the medium term, financing needs to support Asia’s net-zero transition.
“Singapore’s ecosystem of banks, investors, and professional service firms, as well as the digitalisation of bond market infrastructure, will support fund-raising efforts in the region and help channel international capital to support Asia’s growth and net-zero transition needs,” MAS said.
Year to date, the total volume of Singapore dollar-denominated issuances stood at $16.9 billion, compared with $21.3 billion in the same period last year, according to Bloomberg data.
Mr Wong Di Ming, research analyst of the bond research team at Bondsupermart, told The Straits Times that this was expected, given the challenging economic outlook. The higher interest rate environment had made it difficult for corporates to issue debt in 2023, notably in the first half of the year.
“We continue to expect fewer issuances overall for 2023, underpinned by our view of higher-for-longer interest rates,” he said.
Corporates are expected to continue to tap the larger US dollar debt market, which provides more options to choose from.
“That said, for investors who prefer to avoid foreign exchange risk, we recommend sticking to the currency they hold,” Mr Wong said.
The financial sector is expected to continue dominating debt issuances, given that banks benefit from the ongoing high interest rates. Banks are incentivised to raise capital through the debt market to provide for more loans, while at the same time tapping various sources of capital beyond the traditional deposits.",straitstimes
Singapore banks face challenging outlook as loan demand slows,"Singapore banks are likely to face muted results in the second half of 2023 after higher interest rates boosted profits in the first six months of the year.
DBS Group Holdings Ltd., Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. Ltd. and United Overseas Bank Ltd. recently reported double-digit year-over-year increases in net profit for the second quarter, driven by strong net interest income growth. However, loan growth has slowed. The Monetary Authority of Singapore reported a decrease in bank loans to S$799.292 trillion in June from S$841.525 trillion a year earlier.
Loan growth has ""been disappointing,"" reflecting weaker customer demand due to high loan repricing, Thilan Wickramasinghe, head of equity research at Maybank Securities, told S&P Global Market Intelligence in an email. ""Unless there is a significant increase in credit demand, we anticipate that earnings will decrease in the second half of the year.""
Singaporean banks have benefited from rising interest rates since early 2022, when most central banks began tightening policy to combat inflation. Lenders were able to pass higher rates on to their borrowers as economies emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic. Tightening has slowed in recent months, and most economists believe that interest rates are about to peak.
""The banks' earnings in the first half exceeded expectations. Interest income was stronger than anticipated, primarily due to net interest margins holding up. However, there are indications that this trend may be weakening,"" Wickramasinghe said.
Challenges ahead
Bank chiefs have also flagged a more challenging second half of the year.
DBS' total loans in the first six months of 2023 stood at S$415.71 billion, down from S$424.53 billion in the first half of 2022. OCBC's total loans for the first half totaled S$297 billion, compared to S$298 billion in the prior-year period. UOB's net customer loans for the first half dropped to S$314.65 billion from S$317.53 billion in the first half of 2022.
DBS CEO Piyush Gupta expects ""low single-digit loan growth"" for the full year. ""Our pipelines through the second half of the year are looking reasonable, so I think for the full year we could still get low single-digit loan growth, but it will not be the earlier guidance of 3% to 5%,"" Gupta said during the bank's Aug. 3 media briefing.
OCBC and UOB also expect single-digit loan growth for 2023.
At OCBC's Aug. 4 earnings briefing, CEO Helen Wong predicted ""low to mid-single-digit loan growth potentially at the lower end,"" even as the bank still sees opportunities to increase its loan portfolio in segments such as energy, power and utilities. UOB also expects ""low to mid-single-digit loan growth"" and will focus on high-quality customers, CEO Ee Cheong Wee said in a July 27 briefing.
All three banks reported second-quarter net profit growth as interest rates boosted income. Net interest margins (NIMs) also improved due to unexpected rate hikes from the US Federal Reserve in July.
Margin surprise
In the second quarter, DBS Group's NIM increased to 2.16% from 1.58% a year ago. OCBC's NIM rose to 2.28% from 1.71%, while UOB's NIM went up to 2.13% from 1.63% a year ago.
DBS' Gupta said the NIM growth was a ""bit of a surprise"" as the CEO had previously predicted NIMs may peak between 2.05% and 2.10% this year.
The higher NIMs could help banks maintain profit growth for the rest of 2023 as margins are higher than they were in the second half of 2022, Michael Makdad, equity analyst at Morningstar, told Market Intelligence.
""It's sufficient for profit growth year on year even without loan growth and feeble recovery in fee income. Hopefully, the recovery in fee income gains pace, but that probably depends on market sentiment, as wealth management fees are sensitive to market conditions,"" Makdad said.
Makdad, however, expects flat NIMs in the second half and margins to eventually narrow in early 2024. Banks can maintain their ""double-digit profit growth overall in the second half, but not in 2024 as year-earlier comparisons get progressively more challenging,"" Makdad said.

Singapore banks' margins may level off in 2023 as policy tightening nears end,"Singapore's largest banks may see their net interest margins expand at a slower pace in 2023 as central banks approach the limits of monetary policy tightening, bringing the lenders' fee income into focus.
Although the U.S. Federal Reserve indicated that its tightening cycle may last a bit longer, most analysts believe interest rates may be nearing a peak as global economic growth grinds lower. This could affect the profits of Singapore's three largest banks by assets — DBS Group Holdings Ltd.; Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. Ltd., or OCBC; and United Overseas Bank Ltd., or UOB — in 2023 after rising interest rates boosted their margins in 2022, pushing their full-year net profits to record highs.
""We saw some strong improvements to NIMs. However, expect the trajectory of growth to decelerate in 2023 as funding costs catch up,"" Thilan Wickramasinghe, Maybank Securities Singapore's head of research, told S&P Global Market Intelligence. ""Asset quality remains benign. Provisioning costs could have upside risks going forward, especially as the full impact of higher interest rates and slower global growth starts to bite.""
Singapore was one of the first Asian countries to embark on a tightening cycle as early as October 2021. While rising policy rates boosted banks' NIMs, they have also pushed their cost of borrowing higher.
Improved margins
Margins at the banks rose year over year for full year 2022. DBS Group reported a NIM of 1.75% in 2022, up from 1.45% in 2021. OCBC posted a year-over year increase in its NIM for the period to 1.91% from 1.54%, while UOB's NIM rose to 1.86% from 1.56%.
""Net interest margin may be peaking out but unlikely to narrow much if at all in 2023, assuming there is no sudden development prompting the U.S. Fed to cut interest rates aggressively,"" Michael Makdad, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, told Market Intelligence via email.
Analysts expect the major banks to continue to see strong earnings in 2023. The mean consensus estimate for DBS Group's net income for full year 2023 was S$9.90 billion, according to data compiled by Market Intelligence on March 1. OCBC's net income is estimated to come to S$6.95 billion for full year 2023, while UOB's net income is expected to be S$5.63 billion.
Wild card
As the margins of the three large Singapore banks may have little room to rise further, fees from wealth management could be a growth engine for the lenders in 2023.
""The contribution from wealth management, which has seen major contraction, remains a wild card,"" Wickramasinghe said. ""On one hand, all three banks have seen credible [assets under management] inflows, but on the other hand, for clients to deploy these to higher fee paying products, the outlook for interest rates needs to be clearer.""
Piyush Gupta, CEO of DBS Group, said during the bank's Feb. 13 earnings call that the lender can expect an increase in revenue as its AUM keeps increasing. The bank's reported wealth management AUM increased 3% in constant currency terms to S$297 billion in 2022 from S$291 billion in 2021.
""There is a dependent benefit because, for example, a lot of the AUMs that are coming in are now ultra high net worth, family office kind of stuff and that allows us to create two, three additional ecosystems,"" Gupta said.",spglobal
