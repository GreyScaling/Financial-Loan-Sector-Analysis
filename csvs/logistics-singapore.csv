Singapore’s logistics industry is changing to build long-term resilience,"Singapore’s logistics industry is facing significant change led by heterogeneous forces due to the interconnectedness of global supply chains and vast number of players. Focusing on strategies that benefit the long-term such as digitalisation and workplace transformation will propel the logistics industry into future growth and secure Singapore’s competitive advantage as world-class logistics hub for years to come.   As a high frequency supply chain node linked to more than 600 ports worldwide, Singapore’s logistics industry has been significantly tested during the past two pandemic years (years 2020 and 2021). Border closures and strict regulations that varied in time and severity across countries caused significant disruptions in trade flows. In addition, ongoing geopolitical tensions and rising fuel costs created more stressors on the supply chain process. On the home front, safe management protocols in Singapore led to a surge in supply chain demands which logistics operators struggled to fulfil due to manpower shortage – an issue that was already present pre-pandemic but now exacerbated by cross-border regulations. Findings from IndSights Research’s quarterly Business Sentiment Survey (BSS) showed that Singapore logistics companies’ sentiments on their business situation over the last two years have fluctuated in tandem with changes in pandemic and macroeconomic conditions. Still, overall, the logistics industry’s perception has been less negative compared to most other sectors.  The logistics industry also grapples with enduring business pressures to increase efficiencies in order to meet tight source-to-deliver cycles and maintain dock-to-stock process accuracies, all while managing operational resources. Still, local logistics companies appear to have fared better than most. Our BSS data shows that the logistics industry experienced more positive changes in revenues overall compared to their industry peers throughout the pandemic years. Revenue dips (possibly in reaction to sudden COVID-19 restrictions) rebounded in the subsequent quarters as logistics operators likely managed to adapt to the unabating demands for supply chain services.   The pandemic has accelerated the need for digitalisation across the business landscape. As the logistics industry provides key support to a wide range of sectors from infrastructure and construction, healthcare and pharmaceutical, to retail and food services, the rate of digital disruption to traditional supply chain processes will intensify alongside other sectors’ progress.  Further, digitalisation has also facilitated new entrants into the sectors, hence creating increased competition. For example, digital adoption in the retail and food sector spurred the rise of e-commerce and in turn, created a needs-gap in the last-mile delivery market. An example of new entrants to the last-mile delivery market, is Grab, which saw the opportunity to launch GrabExpress, offering agile pricing for on-demand, same-day parcel and courier delivery services for home-based businesses and online retailers. Industry experts have long recommended that logistics companies adopt technological solutions to strip out inefficiencies throughout the supply chain functions to lift productivity. Findings from the BSS indicated that Singapore logistics players recognised the benefits of embracing new technologies as more are looking to invest in digitalisation in 2022 compared to 2021, and more so than other sectors.

Preparing for the future of logistics – the Singapore way,"The government of Singapore recently outlined its vision for the country’s future, describing how different sectors could harness technology, innovation and mega-trends in order to take the city-state to the next level. This approach includes a dedicated Industry Transformation Map for the logistics sector, which accounts for 7.7% of Singapore’s GDP and over 8% of jobs. Logistics is also understood as a crucial enabler for other significant parts of the economy, such as manufacturing and trade. How is Singapore anticipating the transformation of logistics? Singapore has been considered a major logistics hub for quite some time, and is currently ranked first in Asia according to the Word Bank’s Logistics Performance Index. The sector, however, is experiencing significant transformations such as the rise of digitally enabled logistics services, and the emergence of new delivery capabilities (autonomous vehicles, 3D printing). The Industry Transformation Map (ITM) will help Singaporean logistics keep its competitive edge in this rapidly evolving context, and aims to achieve a value-added of S$8.3billion (US$6 billion) by 2020. In particular, the ITM intends to strengthen innovation, productivity, as well as talent development across the logistics sector—including by leveraging trends such as artificial intelligence and collaborative robotics:   Three Interesting takeaways for emerging economies Trends such as automation, asset-sharing, and the internet of things are changing the world we live in and transforming supply chains. By preparing their workforce and investing in innovation today, developing economies have a unique opportunity to jump ahead of the curve and invest for their future!
