"Singapore, Long Beach, Los Angeles Ports Unveil Green, Digital Shipping Corridor Partnership Strategy","At the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), Port of Long Beach and Port of Los Angeles unveiled a Partnership Strategy for a green and digital shipping corridor across the Pacific Ocean. The scope of cooperation and success indicators specified in the strategy reaffirm the corridor partners’ commitment to drive global action to digitalize and decarbonize the shipping industry and improve efficiencies. The release of the Partnership Strategy follows the signing of a memorandum of understanding by MPA, Port of Long Beach and Port of Los Angeles during Singapore Maritime Week in April 2023. The signing formalized the partnership, supported by C40 Cities, to establish a green and digital shipping corridor connecting the three global hub ports. “Over the last two decades, we’ve learned that collaboration between maritime industry partners is the key to making meaningful progress in reducing emissions and cleaning the air,” said Port of Long Beach CEO Mario Cordero. “This trans-Pacific green shipping corridor takes this concept global. The strategies we develop here can be used as a roadmap by a larger network of seaports and supply chain companies to invest in programs, technologies, software and infrastructure to decarbonize international trade everywhere.” “This Partnership Strategy document is the foundation upon which we’ll build the future of maritime shipping,” said Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka. “Our success requires the resolve and dedication of the three partnering ports and our industry partners. We will model the collaboration necessary to achieve our climate and efficiency goals.” The strategy released Wednesday outlines steps to accelerate decarbonization of the maritime shipping industry by enabling first-mover organizations to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by the earliest feasible date, in support of the goals defined by the 2023 International Maritime Organization’s Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships. The ports and C40 will work together with value-chain stakeholders from the fuel and maritime sectors to: To achieve these aims, a partnership structure and governance mechanism have been developed to clarify corridor partners’ roles and responsibilities. The strategy also outlines onboarding new participants, financial management, confidentiality and decision-making processes. As the next steps, the ports and C40 have commissioned a study to analyze trade flows and vessel traffic between Singapore, Los Angeles and Long Beach. The study will estimate the quantity of near-zero and zero-emission fuels required for this traffic and guide implementation by identifying collaboration opportunities to advance the corridor’s development. The founding partners will now engage stakeholders from across the shipping and fuel supply value chains who share the partnership’s vision and aim to onboard new corridor participants in 2024. “We are excited to see this partnership grow from strength to strength with the Green and Digital Shipping Corridor Partnership Strategy,” said Teo Eng Dih, Chief Executive of the MPA. “We have evaluated the various digital solutions and zero and near-zero fuel options that could be trialled along the route between Singapore and the San Pedro Bay Port Complex. We look forward to the support of all the corridor stakeholders over the coming months to conduct trials and potentially scale them for wider adoption.” “C40 is proud to support our port partners in delivering this Partnership Strategy. The advancement of this Green and Digital Shipping Corridor brings the shipping sector closer to a 1.5 degrees Celsius-aligned trajectory,” said C40 Cities Executive Director Mark Watts. “Green shipping is only achievable through collaboration because no stakeholder can afford to move unless they know others are likely to follow. That’s where C40 is delighted to help, bringing our network of world-leading cities, which include most of the world’s largest and most forward-looking ports.”",logistics_manager,Logistics,Singapore
CEVA Logistics drives Logistics Sustainability in Malaysia,"CEVA Logistics recently installed a new solar panel system at the company’s facility in Bukit Jelutong, Malaysia. More than 1,000 panels were installed on the warehouse’s roof, with an expected annual production of 840,000 KWH to power lighting and air conditioning for the warehouse and offices. Jaiganesh Velamuthu, managing director for Malaysia, CEVA Logistics, said: “This is a good start and the right decision. CEVA will continue to look for better ways to run our Malaysia business sustainably and to help reduce carbon emissions by adopting new technologies in our facilities.” CEVA Logistics is reducing logistics-related carbon emissions by powering its warehouses with solar energy. The Bukit Jelutong site offers more than 316,000 square feet of space, providing contract logistics solutions mainly for consumer goods customers. With the installation of 2,800 square meters of solar panels, CEVA expects to reduce annual emissions by 500 tonnes of carbon dioxide. The company expects to add solar panels to a second warehouse on the Bukit Jelutong site in 2023. Together, they will cover 60 per cent of the total roof space of CEVA’s sites in Malaysia. CEVA plans to add more than 400 solar panels to its 73,000-square-foot, multi-customer warehouse in Bayan Lepas in the first quarter of 2023. This new installation will contribute another 6 per cent of solar panel coverage and is projected to reduce the facility’s electricity consumption by 40 per cent and reduce emissions by 200 tonnes yearly.
