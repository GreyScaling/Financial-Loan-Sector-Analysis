"Prime office, industrial rental growth to subside in 2024, says expert","Retail is poised to buck the trend.
Singapore’s CBD Grade A office space and industrial sector are both projected to see softer rental growth next year while retail leasing is set to continue its rally, Cushman & Wakefield said in a recent report. 
The property agency’s later projections show that CBD Grade A office rent will likely remain unchanged or slow down to a 2% growth next year due to high supply. This is a dip from 2023’s projected 2.5% to 3% increase, which had already drastically dropped from the 6.5% forecast in 2022.
“With more options in the market, occupiers with expiring leases in 2024/2025 should take this opportunity to negotiate their leases. This window of opportunity may be fleeting as the market will return to a tight supply situation post-2024,” the report stated.
Industrial rents will moderate as well since recovery is fragile as interest rates are likely to remain elevated in the long term. Rental growth could be cut in half as prime logistics is expected to slow down growth to only 5% next year.
Emerging interest in warehouses is also curbed by a scarcity of supply, with vacancy rates for warehouses remain lower to pre-pandemic levels. However, occupiers could also explore build-to-suit opportunities themselves or partner with developers to secure expansion sites and manage real estate costs given the surge in prime logistics rent.
“With a tight supply situation persisting into 2024, warehouses could see continued but tapering off rental growth into 2024, as tenants are increasingly resistant to rents which have nearly doubled since the pandemic,” the report read.

Meanwhile, the property agency expects retail landlords to enjoy healthy rental growth next year as the recovering tourism and revenge spending drive the city-state past pre-Covid numbers.
“Orchard prime retail rental growth should continue to outpace other submarkets at 2%-4% YOY amidst recovering tourism,” the report said.
Higher rents and labour shortages could, however, push struggling brands to bow out but landlords expect vacancies to be occupied quickly.
Retailers have also been adjusting their business strategies given the competition with online entertainment and shopping platforms, as well as consumer interest shifting to more experimental concepts.",sbr,Industrials,Singapore
Singapore and China join forces with new green finance taskforce,"The regulatory landscape is pivotal, providing clarity for markets to flourish. Countries like Singapore and China have embraced new sustainable finance regulations, guiding the financial sector toward eco-friendly and socially responsible ventures. Fourteen Asian states and ASEAN have developed or are in the process of developing green taxonomies. China established its Green Bond Catalogue in 2015, while Singapore is currently finalising its forthcoming green taxonomy.
Building upon their sustainable finance policies and regulations, Singapore and China have elevated their collaborative efforts. In April 2023, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the People’s Bank of China unveiled the China–Singapore Green Finance Taskforce — a seminal stride aimed at amplifying bilateral cooperation in green and transition finance across Singapore, China and East Asia. Comprising a public–private consortium of expert members including commercial banks, such as Singapore-based DBS, sovereign wealth funds and Chinese regional banks, the taskforce functions as a conduit for the exchange of best practices and knowledge.
This initiative aims to boost investment in green technology and promote decarbonisation by streamlining the issuance of sustainable financial instruments. The Singapore Exchange and China International Capital Corporation will jointly establish a workstream with the goal of fortifying connectivity within the sustainability bond market between the two nations. This endeavour encompasses the mutual issuance of — and access to — green and transition bond products across China and Singapore.
Collaborative efforts between the Metaverse Green Exchange and China Beijing Green Exchange are also integral to this facilitation. Their cooperative workstream will harness technology to expedite the adoption of sustainable finance, including piloting digital green bonds accompanied by carbon credits.
The hybrid and expert-based character of the taskforce should facilitate greater public–private sector collaboration in China and Singapore on concrete products and instruments. This will catalyse capital flows to support a credible and inclusive transition to low-carbon business activities.
Investing in sustainable finance products offers substantial long-term benefits. It provides investors with an opportunity to invest in infrastructure while also meeting their climate commitments. It also reduces any regulatory risks associated with investments that are not aligned with the transition. Facilitating the issuance of green bonds for sustainable projects and bolstering financing mechanisms are poised to invigorate the sustainable finance market in the region.
The taskforce will also collaborate on Singapore’s green taxonomies and China’s Green Bond Catalogue. To combat greenwashing and to infuse greater clarity into sustainable finance markets, novel regulations, such as taxonomies, have adopted a prescriptive stance on what qualifies as ‘sustainable’ and outlined methodologies for its evaluation.
But the multifarious regulatory standards adopted across different jurisdictions can engender disparities, posing challenges to the effective oversight of global financial activities. Singapore and China’s collaboration holds importance in the face of complexities introduced by financial globalisation.
The Monetary Authority of Singapore and the People’s Bank of China are collaborating through the International Platform on Sustainable Finance (IPSF) — a discussion forum comprising representatives from national central banks and finance ministries. IPSF’s Steering Committee and Taxonomy Workgroup are dedicated to jointly developing globally harmonised sustainable finance alignment tools, considering local nuances and transition factors. IPSF has worked on a Common Ground Taxonomy to establish interoperability between the EU Sustainable Finance Taxonomy and China’s Green Bond Endorsed Project Catalogue.
Likewise, China and Singapore are striving for interoperability between their respective taxonomies. To achieve interoperability, it is important to align certain design aspects. These aspects include having similar objectives and utilising comparable sector classification systems to define economic activities.
The cooperation will need to overcome certain hurdles. For instance, clarifying whether and to what extent social aspects will be part of the taxonomy. There is also the question of how to classify transitional business activities. The amber classification serves to distinguish transitional activities from wholly sustainable ones, but signals their relevance for the green transition to investors. The colour differentiation approach is being adopted by Singapore but not by China.
The bilateral endeavour undertaken by China and Singapore bears considerable significance. Sustainable finance taxonomies play a crucial role in bringing clarity to global sustainable finance markets. But their efficacy hinges on regulators collaborating to develop a shared understanding of definitions and how to measure green and transition activities.
The initiative taken by China and Singapore could be expanded to involve a wider set of countries in Asia through existing regional institutions. ASEAN has established its own Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance, but the ASEAN taxonomy is a non-binding instrument that serves as a template for member states’ respective national taxonomies. The bilateral cooperation between China and Singapore could, in the future, also involve ASEAN and its member states.

Lower electricity bills expected this year as global energy prices stabilise: Geneco CEO,"SINGAPORE - Households and businesses in Singapore can look forward to cheaper electricity bills in 2023 as global energy prices begin to stabilise.
Mr Lim Han Kwang, chief executive of electricity provider Geneco, told The Straits Times in a recent interview that the steep drop in gas prices seen globally, as well as falling oil prices, should give Singaporeans who have been battling rising living costs some reprieve.
“Singapore imports all its natural gas, and the price of the natural gas we import is pegged to global oil prices,” he said, adding that the bulk of the Republic’s procurements were based on long-term contracts.
“We have observed seven quarters of increase, starting in early 2021 through the third quarter of 2022, in the regulated electricity tariff as a result of higher global energy prices.
“But in the last two quarters, that trend has turned as prices ease.”
Energy prices rose further following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with Europe scouring the world to find alternative supply options to Russian gas and oil as countries were ramping up economic activity after the lifting of Covid-19-related restrictions.
But recent industry data suggests investors are turning bearish.
By signing up, I accept SPH Media's Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy as amended from time to time.
In the first two weeks of March, traders sold oil-related futures and options contracts at the quickest rate in almost six years, bracing themselves for the onset of a recession driven by tighter credit conditions, while the unfolding banking crisis keeps markets on edge.
The benchmark ICE Brent crude contract traded as low as US$70 a barrel in March, down from its high of US$88 seen earlier in the year.
“With the further easing of global oil prices, we can expect lower electricity prices this year as compared with 2022,” said Mr Lim, who cautioned consumers to not let their guard down.
“The market remains volatile, and any significant events that affect the global oil price will have a direct correlation to our electricity prices here in Singapore.”
Mr Lim, 46, said that consumers could better mitigate sudden price fluctuations by opting for longer-term fixed price plans instead of leaving themselves exposed to the quarterly adjustments seen in the regulated tariff.
“With the full liberalisation of the retail market, consumers are allowed to choose where they buy their electricity from, and for peace of mind, they can consider fixing their electricity rates for either six, 12 or 24 months,” he said.
While electricity prices are expected to be cheaper in 2023, he expects demand in the Republic to grow. This, however, will be at a slower rate of around 1 per cent to 1.5 per cent due to the cooling of Singapore’s economy as forecasted by the Ministry of Trade and Industry.
He said that in 2022, with the return of economic activities following the gradual relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions in Singapore, demand for electricity recovered to above pre-pandemic levels.
“Electricity consumption in Singapore is closely correlated with Singapore’s economic activity. In 2022, we saw around 2 per cent growth in electricity demand as compared with 2021, with peak demand at 7,300 megawatts.”
Geneco, which is Singapore’s top residential electricity supplier serving more than 160,000 homes, has also been working on projects to reduce its own carbon footprint, said Mr Lim.
According to The Energy 2050 Committee Report released by the Energy Market Authority (EMA) in 2022, Singapore’s power sector now contributes about 40 per cent of the country’s emissions. 
But the report also highlighted that the sector could realistically lower this down to net-zero by 2050, by importing more clean energy through regional power grids, developing infrastructure suitable for clean-burning hydrogen to be used as a fuel, and maximising solar panel deployment.
One of the initiatives launched since Mr Lim helmed the company has been Singapore’s first and only customisable green add-on for a residential electricity plan.
He hopes this will encourage more households to proactively contribute to the global effort to fight climate change.
“With an increasing awareness of climate change and the desire by consumers to contribute to the environment, we believe that the take-up rate of our Power Eco Add-on, Singapore’s first and only customisable green add-on, will increase,” he said.
Under the initiative, Mr Lim said consumers will get to choose the amount of carbon credits or Renewable Energy Certificates to offset the carbon emission of their power consumption when they sign up for a residential electricity plan with Geneco.
Since 2021, he highlighted that Geneco has pledged to plant 250 trees by 2025 in support of the Singapore Green Plan 2030, a nationwide movement launched by the National Parks Board in 2022 to plant one million trees.
“To commemorate our 160,000-home milestone in 2022, we went the extra mile and planted 150 trees in September, adding on to the 50 planted earlier in April,” said Mr Lim, who has been working in the power sector since 2002. “This reinforces our commitment to tackling climate change by playing an active role in greening Singapore.”
Among the other projects the company is currently evaluating that will help it reduce carbon emissions, it is studying the feasibility of retrofitting its existing power plants to run on a mixture of natural gas and hydrogen, said Mr Lim.
He added that YTL PowerSeraya, Geneco’s parent company, was also reviewing investments in hydrogen and ammonia cycle power plants, which is in alignment with the direction of national policy.
Singapore has taken a significant step towards promoting sustainable energy by implementing a National Hydrogen Strategy, which seeks to leverage hydrogen as a major decarbonisation pathway to diversify the country’s power mix.
Mr Lim said hydrogen, an environmentally friendly fuel that produces no greenhouse gases when burned, was a promising option for reducing emissions. 
The Republic’s strategy, first announced by Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong at the Singapore International Energy Week in late October 2022, aims to establish a hydrogen ecosystem that can support various applications, including power generation and transportation. 
Mr Lim backed the country’s hydrogen strategy, which has the potential to meet half of Singapore’s electricity demand by 2050 alongside renewable energy and imported electricity.
“We are optimistic about the future, and are committed to doing what’s right for the environment and future generations, as we support Singaporeans and the Government in the country’s transition to net zero,” he said.",straitstimes,Industrials,Singapore
Rebound in S’pore factory activity gains traction in December amid increasing optimism,"SINGAPORE - Factory activity in Singapore bucked the general softening trend across much of Asia, and the turnaround also appears to be gaining traction, with businesses becoming more optimistic about the near-term outlook.
The purchasing managers’ index (PMI), a barometer of the manufacturing sector, rose to 50.5 points in December, up from 50.3 points in the previous month, according to the latest data released by the Singapore Institute of Purchasing and Materials Management (SIPMM) on Jan 3.
The PMI for electronics, a key sector of manufacturing, rose to 50.2 from 50.1 points in November. Readings above 50 points denote growth, whereas those below 50 indicate contraction.
December’s expansion was helped by an acceleration in key indexes, including new orders, new exports, factory output, and input purchases. Also seen accelerating were finished goods and the order backlog.
Meanwhile, the imports index stayed unchanged at 50.1 for a second month, after having contracted for the 15 previous months.
The employment index expanded but at a slower rate in December, along with input prices and future business.
In contrast, supplier deliveries continued to contract for a seventh month.
By signing up, I accept SPH Media's Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy as amended from time to time.
DBS Bank economist Chua Han Teng said the continued expansion in the PMI for both headline manufacturing and the electronics sector gels with the advance gross domestic product estimates released on Jan 2, and together they reflect signs that the Republic’s nascent factory recovery is under way.
OCBC Bank chief economist Selena Ling said the latest data not only showed that manufacturing PMI hit its highest mark since January 2022, but also that Singapore bucked the generally softer manufacturing PMI trend across the rest of Asia.
Only a handful of other key Asian economies have posted upbeat PMIs for December, including China, Indonesia and Vietnam, she noted.
Among the positive signals, Ms Ling highlighted new exports, which are finally reverting to an expansion after shrinking for 16 straight months, as well as the expansion in the future business index, which she said signals continued optimism about the near-term outlook in the first quarter of the new year.
She also zeroed in on the bifurcation between the overall manufacturing PMI and that for the electronics sector.
“These divergences suggest that the manufacturing recovery theme is more mature and is currently led by the non-electronics industries,” said Ms Ling, although she does see green shoots emerging from the electronics sector.
She expects the manufacturing sector to rebound to around 2 per cent growth year on year in 2024, up from 2023’s negative 3.6 per cent.
“This is predicated on world electronics demand stabilising, the global economy making a soft landing, and no escalation in geopolitical tensions,” she said.
“Meanwhile, growth in the global semiconductor industry is likely to be driven by demand for artificial intelligence, particularly due to a greater focus on large language models.”
UOB associate economist Jester Koh said that when compared with preceding months, the improvement in electronics-sector PMI is more broad based, with several sub-indexes turning expansionary.
He added that this is supportive of an electronics cycle upturn through 2024.
Echoing the sentiment, SIPMM executive director Stephen Poh said: “Local manufacturers remain cautiously optimistic of a firm recovery, especially the electronics sector, where global electronics demand appears to be on an uptrend.”
While the economists unanimously expect prospects to brighten in 2024, Mr Chua was more guarded in his optimism, saying that the recovery is likely fragile, given lingering global uncertainties.
“Interest rates remain high in advanced economies, economic conditions are bumpy in China, and lingering geopolitical tensions could still disrupt supply chains,” he noted.
“Although electronics is turning around, we’ll have to wait and see if there’s a sustained expansion; only then can we be sure that the recovery is firm.”",straitstimes,Industrials,Singapore
Singapore targets $160b manufacturing sector boost by 2030: DPM Heng,"Heng Swee Keat put emphasis on three key priorities that the industry must continue to innovate on.
Singapore plans to boost its manufacturing sector’s contribution to $160b by 2030, whilst its current share stood at $130b.
Heng Swee Keat, Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister For Economic Policies said during the opening ceremony of the Industrial Transformation Asia-Pacific (ITAP) 2023 that the country’s current manufacturing share to the gross domestic product (GDP) is at 20%.
“The global economy in 2023 faces challenging headwinds, with implications across all sectors including manufacturing,” Keat emphasised.
From a global perspective, 17% of the world’s output comes from the manufacturing industry.
“Indeed, manufacturing has historically been a springboard for innovations that have been game-changers for global economic and technological advancement,” Keat said.
In last year’s ITAP event, the Singapore government unveiled its Industry Transformation Maps to five key manufacturing sectors, growing jobs to 4,400 in the first semester of 2023.
Three key priorities
Three key areas demand innovation in manufacturing. First, innovation for performance is vital in reinforcing supply chain resilience through efficiency and connectivity, pressed Keat.
In the era of disruptions and geopolitical uncertainties, smarter and more connected manufacturing will reduce risks and tap into new growth areas, particularly in Asia.
Tackling climate change is a collective responsibility, and manufacturing, responsible for one-fifth of global carbon emissions, must do its part. 
Singapore's sustainability efforts, as outlined in the Singapore Green Plan 2030, emphasise a lower carbon footprint, enhanced efficiency, and greater circularity. Innovative solutions, like creating a circular economy for retired EV batteries, are steps toward net-zero manufacturing.
To thrive in Industry 4.0, the manufacturing sector must attract and retain the best talent, Keat said, emphasising scientific expertise, entrepreneurial instincts, and resilience. 
“To thrive in Industry 4.0, the manufacturing sector must attract and retain the best talent, emphasising scientific expertise, entrepreneurial instincts, and resilience. Initiatives like the Global Ready Talent Programme in Singapore support human resource practices that train graduates for roles in the manufacturing sector,” Keat said.
The talent programme has thus far provided 900 engineering internships.

Collaboration efforts
As manufacturing becomes more advanced and precise, global and cross-border connectivity is crucial. Protectionist policies are not the solution; instead, businesses must adapt to stay competitive, and workers must refresh their skills.

“As we enter a world of increasingly advanced and precision manufacturing, complex products will require global and cross-border connectivity,” Keat said.
“In the face of structural changes in the world economy – brought about by new technologies and trends such as climate change and ageing populations in advanced economies – the priority should instead be to encourage businesses to adjust and stay competitive and assist workers and talent to refresh their skills to preserve relevance,” added Keat.
Last year alone, the country recorded $22.4b in fixed asset investments driven by big manufacturing projects in the electronics sector.
Keat further urged attendees that countries must pursue bolstering cross-border value chains and partnerships.

Singapore’s economy grew 2.8% in Q4 as manufacturing sector rebounds: Advance estimates,"SINGAPORE: Singapore's economy gained momentum in the fourth quarter of 2023 amid a rebound in the manufacturing sector and continued expansion in construction output.
The economy grew 2.8 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, faster than the 1.0 per cent growth in the preceding quarter, according to advance estimates released by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) on Tuesday (Jan 2).
IKLAN
On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the economy expanded by 1.7 per cent, extending the 1.3 per cent expansion in the previous quarter.
The growth in the fourth quarter was driven by expansions in the manufacturing and construction sectors. The manufacturing sector returned to expansion after three quarters of contraction, according to MTI.
The advance GDP estimates for the fourth quarter are computed largely from data in October and November – the first two months of the quarter.
They are intended as an early indication of GDP growth in the quarter and are subject to revision when more comprehensive data becomes available, said MTI.
For the whole of 2023, the economy grew by 1.2 per cent, moderating from the 3.6 per cent growth in 2022.

SECTOR PERFORMANCES
The manufacturing sector expanded by 3.2 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2023, a turnaround from the 4.7 per cent contraction in the previous quarter.
“Growth in the sector was due to output expansions across all clusters, with the exception of the precision engineering cluster,” MTI said.
On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the manufacturing sector grew by 9.0 per cent in the fourth quarter, accelerating from the 0.3 per cent expansion in the third quarter.
Meanwhile, the construction sector grew by 9.1 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, faster than the 6.2 per cent growth in the previous quarter.
Both public and private sector construction output increased during the quarter, MTI said.

On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the pace of growth in the construction sector picked up to 4.3 per cent in the fourth quarter, from 0.8 per cent in the third quarter.
Among the services sectors, the wholesale and retail trade and transportation and storage sectors as a whole grew by 1.5 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, extending the 1.3 per cent growth in the previous quarter.
All sectors within the group recorded expansions.
“Growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector was supported by both wholesale and retail trade activities. Meanwhile, the expansion of the transportation and storage sector was partly driven by the air transport segment, which saw robust growth on the back of the continued recovery in air passengers handled at Changi Airport,” said MTI.
On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the wholesale and retail trade and transportation and storage sectors as a whole shrank by 1.4 per cent in the fourth quarter, a pullback from the 0.6 per cent growth in the preceding quarter.

The group of sectors comprising the information and communications, finance and insurance, as well as professional services sectors grew by 3.9 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, extending the 2.5 per cent growth in the previous quarter.
All sectors within the group expanded during the quarter.
Growth in the information and communications sector was led by the IT and information services segment, while that in the professional services sector was mainly driven by the other professional, scientific and technical services segment, MTI said.
For the finance and insurance sector, growth was primarily supported by activities auxiliary to financial services, which include payment processing activities.
On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the sectors in the group collectively expanded by 2.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, faster than the 1.6 per cent growth in the third quarter.
The remaining group of services sectors - comprising accommodation and food services, real estate, administrative and support services, and other services sectors - grew by 2.0 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, moderating from the 3.9 per cent growth in the previous quarter.
Within the group, the accommodation, real estate and other services sectors recorded expansions during the quarter.
“In particular, the accommodation and other services sectors continued to expand in tandem with the ongoing recovery in tourist arrivals,” said MTI.
On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis, the sectors in the group collectively contracted by 0.7 per cent in the fourth quarter, a reversal of the 0.7 per cent expansion in the previous quarter.
The preliminary GDP estimates for the fourth quarter and whole of 2023 will be released in the Economic Survey of Singapore in February 2024.
""LESS FAVOURABLE"" EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT AHEAD
In his New Year message for 2024 on Sunday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Singapore's economy grew 1.2 per cent in 2023 to avoid a recession.
Mr Lee pointed out challenges ahead as geopolitical uncertainties continue to weigh on the global economy.
2024's gross domestic product has been projected to grow by 1 per cent to 3 per cent, although ""much will depend on the external environment"", he said.
""For some years to come, we must expect the external environment to be less favourable to our security and prosperity,"" Mr Lee said.
""In our own region, there are tensions and risks over rival claims in the South China Sea, and because of the cross-Strait situation,"" he added. ""These can affect confidence in the region, and hence our growth.""
Mr Lee also said that climate change will also have an impact on the economy.
""Climate change will pose major challenges for every country. We are already feeling its effects,"" he said.
""Singapore needs to adapt to and prepare for rising temperatures and sea levels, and to transition our economy to net-zero carbon emissions. It will be costly and demanding.""",channelnewsasia,Industrials,Singapore
Singapore’s Tourism Boosts Economy Amidst Global Challenges,"SINGAPORE: International travel was one bright spot, and perhaps even a saving grace for the economy, based on a May 25 (Thursday) report from the Ministry of Trade and Industry of final estimates for the first quarter of this year.
It showed that Singapore’s economy grew by 0.4 percent year-on-year in the first quarter, following the 2.1 percent expansion from the previous quarter.
The manufacturing sector showed a decrease of 5.6 percent year-on-year, worse than the 2.6 percent contraction it saw in the last quarter of 2022, while the construction sector grew by 7.2 percent, with an increase in both the public and private sector construction.
And while overall, the transportation and storage sector has slowed, air transport and land transport have expanded, with the former especially due to the recovery of international travel.
The accommodation sector has done even better, expanding by 21.9 percent year-on-year and improving upon the 7.8 percent growth it saw in the previous quarter.
This growth is also due to a strong recovery in international visitor arrivals.
Notably, the food and beverage sector has also expanded 12.2 percent yearly due to bigger volumes at food caterers and restaurants.
MTI added in its report that the growth outlook for the aviation- and tourism-related sectors of the Singapore economy remains positive, given the ongoing recovery in international air travel and inbound tourism.
These include the air transport, accommodation and arts, entertainment and recreation sectors, and the aerospace segment of the transport engineering cluster.
The ministry also wrote that it expects the economic growth to be between 0.5 to 2.5 percent for this year.",theindependent,Industrials,Singapore
