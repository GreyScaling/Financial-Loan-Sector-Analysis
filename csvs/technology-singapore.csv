Tech spending in Singapore to jump 4.6% in 2023 to $22.17b ,"Software will be the highest growth area in terms of spend.
Singaporean government and business spending on tech goods and services will likely increase by 4.6% in 2023 to $22.17b, data from Forrester showed.
In a report, Forrester said software will be the highest growth area in 2023, with an expected spend of $7.0b.
Communications equipment ($5.1b vs $5.0b) ), tech outsourcing and hardware maintenance ($3.6b vs $3.3b), and tech consulting and systems integration services ($3.3b vs $3.1b) will also see a spending increase in 2023. 
Forrester said it expects tech spending growth in Singapore on the back of its 2022 measures such as the Productivity Solutions Grant, the Enterprise Development Grant, and the SkillsFuture Enterprise Credit. 
In 2023, Singapore also implemented a $4b top-up to the National Productivity Fund and tax deductions for businesses that conduct R&D through the new Enterprise Innovation Scheme.
Whilst the “Silicon Valley of Asia” remains as a  global leader in digital and AI readiness, Forrester said Singapore must invest in developing local digital skills and improve the cost base for companies and tech talent.
“Singapore has faced an almost unprecedented rise in living costs, driven by a surging rental market. It’s already the most expensive city in the world; seven in 10 businesses say they are ready to relocate personnel elsewhere if costs do not stabilize,” the report stated.
“Rising costs have also affected the return of talent; the expatriate workforce only came close to regaining pre-pandemic numbers in December 2022. This is significant because up to two-thirds of tech sector professionals are from abroad,” it added.",sbr,Technology,Singapore

New S$55m media funding aims to enhance virtual production in Singapore and help dramas go global,"SINGAPORE: Singapore is channelling more funds into its media landscape to help local companies and talents work with international partners, as well as deepen their skills in virtual productions.
The Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) on Wednesday (Dec 6) launched a S$30 million (US$22.5 million) International Co-Production Fund to encourage local media firms to collaborate with foreign producers, directors and scriptwriters.
IKLAN
The initiative supports the creation of drama series with a distinct Singapore flavour and international appeal, and aims to help these shows go global.
Another S$25 million will be set aside for the Virtual Production Innovation Fund that aims to further develop the industry’s virtual production capabilities.
Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information Tan Kiat How announced the two funds at the opening of the Asia TV Forum and Market at the Marina Bay Sands.
The event is part of the Singapore Media Festival, which brings together the region’s media entrepreneurs, talents, creators and consumers. About 50,000 participants from 60 countries are expected to attend the 11-day festival, which celebrates its 10th edition this year.
S$30 MILLION CO-PRODUCTION FUND
The co-production fund aims to bring Singapore stories to a global audience through streaming platforms, in collaboration with production partners overseas.
IKLAN
Mr Tan said the initiative will create fresh opportunities for local media talents to deepen their expertise by working and learning alongside international counterparts in key creative roles.
“More international co-productions will showcase our Singaporean talent beyond our shores. We are making big investments in this space, helping our local media work with global counterparts in terms of production and distribution,” he said.
The fund is available to local media companies with a track record in long-form content, and who are interested in cross-border co-productions with a goal of reaching overseas viewers. Firms can submit their proposals to IMDA from next Monday until Jan 31 next year.
The fund complements a range of overseas co-production initiatives, including programmes that spotlight Singapore as a destination through content, and help local talent build their skills and portfolios.
S$25 MILLION VIRTUAL PRODUCTION FUND
The virtual production fund is part of efforts to develop more local talent and technologies to meet the increasing demand for such shows in the industry.
IKLAN
This emerging technology uses real-time visual effects to supplement traditional filmmaking and post-production. It can be an alternative to filming on location or on physical sets.
The fund was first launched in December last year at S$5 million and has supported 20 projects so far.
For instance, Mediacorp used virtual production to enhance storytelling in its upcoming Chinese drama series titled Once Upon A New Year’s Eve, which is slated to air early next year. Historical scenes such as 1970s Chinatown and the old National Library at Stamford Road were brought back to life using virtual production technologies.
Besides television and film, the technology can also be applied to other sectors such as marketing and digital campaigns, as well as educational initiatives. The Olympic Esports Week held in Singapore in June also used such technology for its opening and closing ceremonies.
The fresh funds will be used to grow the local talent pool by hiring overseas trainers and introducing such modules into the existing media curriculum in institutes of higher learning. Both Ngee Ann Polytechnic and Republic Polytechnic will run virtual production programmes from April next year.
IKLAN
Local studios such as Oceanus Media Group and AUX Media are also investing in infrastructure and training programme upgrades to meet the growing demand for this technology.
Oceanus Media Global CEO Nick Tan said training more people to use it will help make virtual production mainstream and elevate Singapore's media scene.
“(Virtual production) gave birth to a whole new world of creativity and better storytelling. Singapore is in a good position to anchor this virtual production into our workflow,” he said.
SHIFTS IN MEDIA LANDSCAPE
Mr Tan said that over the past 10 years, there have been significant shifts in the media landscape, with streaming services and social media platforms revolutionising the way viewers consume content.
“Our media ecosystem has continued to adapt and thrive in this new world. Looking (ahead), there are many exciting opportunities,” he told CNA's Singapore Tonight. “This investment is really our confidence in our talents and our media ecosystem.”
He noted that the Asia-Pacific media market is set to grow from S$1.65 trillion this year to S$2 trillion in 2028.
“We want to help our media ecosystem ride this growth. This is a space where technology meets media, which Singapore can be competitive in,” he said.
“Media is a very important sector for us to tell our own Singapore stories. It builds our cultural identity. It tells stories of our past and our aspirations for the future,” said Mr Tan.
“The media sector is also a good growth industry. It creates good careers, and is also (a sector where we can) expand our economic and market space beyond our little red dot.”",channelnewsasia,Technology,Singapore
"Singapore’s telco market may look saturated, but players are still vying to enter","Singapore’s telco market may appear saturated, but players such as Colt are still vying to set up shop
Colt will offer businesses, but not consumers, high-bandwidth connections to a network of financial centers
NetLink Trust, which operates telecom infrastructure, was set for a $1.68 billion Singapore IPO this week
Tiny Singapore’s telecommunications market may look saturated, but some players are still taking aim at the market.
The existing telcos appear to have the island’s population well-covered: The city-state had a mobile penetration rate of nearly 150 percent as of June 2016, with a residential wired broadband penetration rate of 98.4 percent and a wireless penetration rate of nearly 193 percent, according to government data.
That high penetration rate was likely driven by Singapore’s “Smart Nation” ambition to integrate digital technology seamlessly across work, households and public services to boost efficiency and quality of life.
But one new player, Colt, previously known as City of London Telecom, is pushing into the city-state’s market as part of its 500 million euro (US$573 million) global investment plan for the next three years.
“We don’t think the market is saturated at all. It’s growing,” Carl Grivner, CEO of Colt, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Friday, pointing toward the city-state’s advanced gross domestic product (GDP) growth estimate of 2.5 percent for the second quarter, released on Friday, as “healthy.”
“Singapore was the first market outside of Europe that we wanted to build in,” he said. “In Singapore the market is expected to grow 5 percent a year over the next four years, so we think it’s a great time to come to Singapore.”
Colt isn’t targeting retail consumers, however, aiming instead to build and own a next-generation fiber network, offering high-bandwidth connectivity for businesses between Singapore, Tokyo, Chicago, London, Frankfurt and other global financial centers.
Grivner said that niche was “where we think the real growth is.”
Colt was also aiming at major cities in the U.S., including New York, Chicago, San Francisco, with plans to establish its network presence there.
Singapore’s growing telco competition
Colt’s entry into Singapore came as the city-state’s telco market has faced its biggest shakeup in years.
In 2016, Australia-based TPG Telecom won the rights to become Singapore’s fourth telco operator after the three incumbents — Singtel
, Starhub
and M1
— had the market locked up for 15 years.
TPG’s highly-anticipated entry in December spurred hopes existing players would offer more competitively priced data and mobile bundles, as well as faster speeds.
Homegrown internet services provider MyRepublic, which lost its bid to become the fourth telco, also recently announced plans to launch mobile services in Singapore as early as October.
MyRepublic, which was also aiming for an initial public offering (IPO) by the end of 2018 to fund its expansion in Asia, will join Circles.Life as a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) in the market.
MVNOs provide mobile services by purchasing airtime from one of the current players, instead of developing their own mobile network.
‘Smart Nation’ initiatives drive change
A main driver of the increased activity in Singapore’s telecom market came from the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore’s (IDA) 10-year master-plan, Intelligent Nation 2015, or iN2015, for an “infocomm-enabled future,” offering ultra-high speeds and “intelligent” telco infrastructure.
The IDA later merged with the Media Development Authority of Singapore (MDA), to become the Infocomm Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA)
As part of the master-plan, in 2006, IMDA appointed OpenNet Consortium (now NetLink Trust) as the sole network company to design, build and operate the passive infrastructure, such as ducts, manholes and fiber cables, for Singapore’s ultra high-speed Next Generation National Broadband Network, or Next Gen NBN.
That required Singtel, which owned OpenNet, to divest its stake in the company to separate the passive fiber network infrastructure, the active infrastructure, and the retail service provider layers, with the aim of ensuring fair competition in the retail market.
NetLink Trust CEO Tong Yew Heng told CNBC that he was excited about the long-term prospects of his company, which has a 2.3 billion Singapore dollar ($1.68 billion) IPO, the biggest in Singapore since 2011, set to list on the Singapore Exchange’s (SGX) main board on Wednesday.
NetLink Trust owned a network of approximately 76,000 kilometers of fibre optic cables, 16,200 km of ducts, and 62,000 manholes as of the end of March.The network connects both residential and non-residential locations.
Tong noted that increasingly, households were obtaining more than one fiber connection, adding that might become the norm ahead, which would translate into significant growth in the fiber space.
“In the residential space today, we have more than 1.1 million active end-users and that translates to 76 percent penetration, which is 1.1 million out of an addressable 1.4 million households in Singapore. That number will continue to grow and frankly, I think it will grow beyond a hundred percent,” he said.
Tong does not view the rising competition in the telco space as a threat. “A lot of the telcos are our customers. We support them. We have nationwide coverage, a very extensive fiber-based network.”
Tong also expected that wireless technology would be complementary to a fiber base, which NetLink would be able to support.
“It’s not a substitution to (the) fiber network,” Tong said. He expects the introduction of 5G technology to be positive for the business, simply because it would require the deployment of more base stations and small cell networks across the country than the current 4G network.",cnbc,Technology,Singapore
The past five years for Singapore Telecommunications (SGX:Z74) investors has not been profitable,"In order to justify the effort of selecting individual stocks, it's worth striving to beat the returns from a market index fund. But in any portfolio, there will be mixed results between individual stocks. At this point some shareholders may be questioning their investment in Singapore Telecommunications Limited (SGX:Z74), since the last five years saw the share price fall 25%.
Now let's have a look at the company's fundamentals, and see if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.
View our latest analysis for Singapore Telecommunications
To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.
During the five years over which the share price declined, Singapore Telecommunications' earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 0.4% each year. This reduction in EPS is less than the 5% annual reduction in the share price. So it seems the market was too confident about the business, in the past. The less favorable sentiment is reflected in its current P/E ratio of 11.89.
The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).
We're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. This free interactive report on Singapore Telecommunications' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.
What About Dividends?
When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Singapore Telecommunications the TSR over the last 5 years was -3.8%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!

Singapore’s digital economy – from e-commerce to social media – nearly doubled in five years,"SINGAPORE — Singapore’s digital economy contributed to more than 17% of its gross domestic product in 2022 — higher than the 13% logged in 2017, according to a report by the country’s Infocomm Media Development Authority.
The study, published Friday, revealed that the economic contribution of the digital economy to Singapore’s GDP nearly doubled to 106 billion Singapore dollars ($77.5 billion) in 2022, up from SG$58 billion in 2017, according to CNBC’s calculations.
The digital economy is divided into two parts: the information and communications sector; and digitalization in the rest of the economy.
One-third of the digital economy was driven by the information and communications sector and two-thirds by digitalization in the rest of the economy.
The I&C sector drove digitalization providing services such as telecommunications, computer programming & IT consultancy, cloud computing and software development.
Digitalization in the rest of the economy measures the value generated from investments and spending in digital capital across all sectors excluding those from the I&C sector. They include economic outcomes as a result of firms investing in digital technologies that build value such as reach customers better, optimize business processes as well as innovate products and services.
“The expansion of the digital economy has come on the back of increasing adoption of digital technologies by enterprises, which in turn contributed to the robust growth of tech manpower,” IMDA said in the report.
Based on the latest available data, the digital economies of Estonia, Sweden and the United Kingdom accounted for 16.6%, 15% and 16.1% of their respective GDPs in 2020. Comparatively, Singapore’s digital economy performed better, contributing to 16.7% of its GDP in 2020.
The key sub-sectors driving double-digit growth in the information and communications sector — at a rate of as high as 70% — were games, online services, and e-commerce, according to IMDA. They were driven by increased adoption during the Covid-19 pandemic.
The value-add from digitalization in the rest of the economy increased from SG$38.6 billion in 2017 to SG$72.8 billion in 2022, driven mainly by sectors in finance and insurance, wholesale trade, and manufacturing.
As a result, the value-add from digitalization as a share of the economy rose steadily from 8.7% in 2017 to 11.9% in 2022, the report said.
This is equivalent to an annual compound growth rate of 13.5%, which is faster than the 3.8% growth of Singapore’s GDP in 2022. CAGR is a measure of investment returns, which takes into account what an investment yields at an annual rate over a specified period.
The growth of digitalization in the rest of the economy is driven by more firms stepping up on their use of digital technologies.
The technology adoption rate of businesses grew from 74% in 2018 to 94% in 2022, according to IMDA’s annual survey.
As a result, more tech professionals were deployed across all sectors, with the number of tech jobs growing from about 155,500 in 2017 to 201,100 in 2022.
“Despite the recent tech sector lay-offs, the demand for tech jobs is likely to remain resilient, as the digitalization of the economy deepens,” said IMDA.
“Overall, Singapore’s digital economy has been growing strongly and its longer-term outlook remains positive. The Singapore government continues to be committed to growing a competitive digital economy and fostering a technology-skilled workforce,” said IMDA.
Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said in his budget proposal for 2022 that the government will invest SG$200 million over the next few years into projects that build digital capabilities in businesses and workers.",cnbc,Technology,Singapore
