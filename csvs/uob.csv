ASEAN Consumer Sentiment Study 2023 (Malaysia): Growing appetite for sustainable investments,"Malaysia is on its way towards economic recovery, having climbed five spots to rank 27th in the world’s most competitive economies in 2023 of this year. At the start of Q4, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim had also announced plans to introduce a RM393.8 billion (US$83.4 billion) budget allocation for 2024, the country’s largest to date, in order to achieve 5 per cent economic growth. According to the ASEAN Consumer Sentiment Study 2023 (Malaysia) report, three in four Malaysians anticipate a recession within the next six to 12 months. Their main financial worries comprise rising inflation and increased household expenses. Seventy-five per cent of Malaysians foresee a major economic downturn within the next six to 12 months. The looming threat of a recession has made Malaysians primarily concerned about their capacity to put money into savings (34 per cent), afford daily essentials (30 per cent), and maintain their lifestyles (26 per cent). Thus, they are spending less on jewellery, vacations and dining out and more on groceries and utilities, although overall spending on both essentials and non-essentials has decreased from last year. Malaysia consumers are also now more concerned about finances and their health and well-being compared with 2022, with Gen Y, Mass and Mass Affluent respondents having more health and well-being concerns as compared with last year. Malaysians are looking towards the future with their financial habits. More than one in three consumers are reducing their budgets for expenses, and more than two in five are maintaining existing budget plans for savings and investments. They are also more inclined to put money into insurance than others in the region. The survey also shows that respondents from Malaysia are investing more in properties than the rest of the region. Baby Boomers in particular are keen to explore insurance plans, sustainable investments, green loans, and central bank digital currencies. Malaysians’ strong interest in sustainable investing may be a reflection of the increased concern for health and well-being. Although 58 per cent of Malaysian consumers want to know more about sustainable investing, 87 per cent have cited a need for more sustainable investing solutions in the market. Mass consumers are also seeking more sustainable investing options than other segments. Malaysia consumers’ financial practices reveal some wariness towards financial technology (FinTech) solutions. Seven in 10 Malaysians are comfortable with sharing personal data in banking apps, but they are less comfortable than others in the region.

Sentiments may shift due to the intention to develop Malaysia’s National Digital Identity in Budget 2024, which has the potential to simplify and improve FinTech solutions in the country. Although lower than the regional average, the majority of Malaysians have already adopted sustainable behaviours like using reusable bags, reducing water consumption, switching to energy-efficient appliances, as well as segregating and recycling waste. They are also willing to pay more to buy sustainably produced items, volunteer for, and donate to an environmental organisation. The government is supporting the push for sustainable practices by encouraging electronic vehicle (EV) uptake. Tax exemptions for excise duty, sales tax, and import tax of components have been extended until 2027, along with full tax exemptions for EV charging equipment manufacturers until 2032. Budget 2024 has also announced the allotment of RM2 billion to the National Energy Transition fund and an investment of over RM170 million to leading EV companies for the installation of EV charging stations. Malaysia consumers cite good health and well-being (36 per cent), peace, justice, and strong institutions (36 per cent), and reduced inequalities (35 per cent) as the most important sustainability goals for the country. Mass consumers, though, see health and well-being (52 per cent), decent work and economic growth (46 per cent), and no poverty (42 per cent) as more important goals than other subgroups. Despite financial concerns and recession fears, employees across all categories are more calm at work than previously reported—a sentiment that may be attributed in part to stabilising work conditions since the COVID-19 pandemic. Two in three Malaysians also expect to be in a financially better situation this time next year, which shows more optimism compared with last year. Still, of all subgroups, Mass consumers report the highest dissatisfaction with workplace mental health support and have significantly higher stress levels at work. Along with Gen X, they also feel less optimistic about their financial standing in the coming year than other subgroups. Malaysians see pre-agreed number of work-from-home and work-from-office days (66 per cent), optimal meeting durations (56 per cent), and regular mental health check-ins (47 per cent) as top measures to achieve work-life balance. To improve work-life balance, Malaysian employees would like to see a pre-agreed number of work-from-home days (66 per cent), optimal meeting durations (56 per cent), and regular mental health check-ins (47 per cent).
