0,"SINGAPORE - Going grocery shopping might soon burn an even bigger hole in consumers' pockets, as prices of non-cooked food such as seafood and meat is expected to continue rising even beyond this year as a result of global shocks, a review by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) showed on Thursday (April 28).","The cost of electricity and gas will also be pushed up this year, as the recent surge in global energy prices raises the prices of oil-related items. MAS said that overall, the surge in global energy and agricultural commodity prices will raise domestic inflation for fuel, electricity and gas and non-cooked food, which will in turn feed into higher prices for transport and food services over time. ""The Russia-Ukraine conflict will have significant repercussions on global prices of food, which had already risen to close to record levels before the war,"" said MAS. ""As Ukraine and Russia are both major global exporters of grains and edible oils, the conflict has led to steep price increases in these commodities."" Brent crude oil and natural gas have gone up 33 per cent and 80 per cent respectively so far this year, while wheat has gone up 43 per cent.  Fertiliser costs have also been pushed up by reduced supplies from Russia and Ukraine, which could lead to lower agricultural yield as farmers worldwide scale back on the use of fertilisers, it added. Meanwhile, poor weather conditions in other major grain-producing regions like China and parts of America mean that the shortfall in grain supply is expected to persist till next year. ""Reduced grain supply will result in a protracted increase in the cost of animal feed that will eventually translate to higher global prices of meat and dairy,"" MAS said. This rise in global food prices will also pass through to Singapore's import prices, which will lead to higher domestic non-cooked food inflation over time. But the increase is expected to be gradual in the short term and more modest than global indices, MAS said. ""The incomplete short-run pass-through of higher costs to domestic prices likely reflects firms' ability and willingness, at all stages in the supply chain, to temporarily absorb some cost changes within their profit margins with the aim of preserving market share,"" it added. Singapore's diverse sources of imported food also help to moderate the impact of these supply-driven price shocks, it said. But eventually, domestic food prices will still reflect the higher level of global food prices, which are expected to persist even beyond 2022. Meanwhile, oil-related items will also see price increases, MAS said, noting that the pass-through of global oil prices to domestic petrol pump prices was rapid. ""The surge in European gas futures as a result of the war spilled over to Asian gas futures prices, while some Russian oil has also effectively been kept off the international market due to import bans and 'self-sanctioning' by major oil traders and firms,"" it said. Brent prices are projected to remain at a considerably higher level than before the hostilities, reflecting tight supply conditions and the potential for further oil supply disruptions, it added. For 2022 as a whole, Brent crude oil prices are forecast to average US$105 per barrel, 49 per cent above the US$71 last year. ""Elevated global oil prices, following the surge in March, will continue to place upward pressure on energy tariffs in the third quarter,"" MAS said. It warned that while households on fixed price plans under the Open Electricity Market are temporarily insulated, upcoming renewals of their contracts will occur at sharply higher rates that will reflect the step-up in global energy prices. Core inflation - which excludes accommodation and private transport costs - already hit a 10-year high in March. Both core inflation and headline inflation rose in the first three months of this year, compared with the last quarter of 2021. Higher electricity and gas and non-cooked food inflation accounted for around a third of the increase in core inflation, MAS observed. This was partly the result of stronger price increases in fish, seafood and meat. ""Labour shortages in Singapore's key meat import source countries like Brazil and Malaysia as well as elevated feed costs drove poultry prices higher. The pace of price increases of fruits and vegetables also remained elevated,"" MAS said. As consumer demand recovered, inflation for discretionary services and retail goods also rose. This includes higher prices for hawker and restaurant meals, taxi and private-hire car services, sport services and other fees, cinema tickets and charges to places of interest. Import costs rose more strongly for travel goods and handbags, apparel and clothing accessories, and photographic apparatus and equipment. Airfares inflation also jumped, contributing to about a fifth of the increase in core inflation, MAS noted. But as Covid-19 test requirements here and in other destinations were relaxed, airfares in the first quarter of 2022 fell when compared with the preceding quarter. Essential services inflation also rose, with price revisions such as the public transport fare hike and increase in household refuse collection fees. The effects of some pre-school subsidies introduced early last year also faded, contributing to the step-up in education inflation.",straitstimes,Consumer Goods,Singapore
1,"SINGAPORE – Between $32 billion and $38 billion in construction contracts are expected to be awarded in 2024, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) said on Jan 15. ","An estimated $33.8 billion worth of contracts were awarded in 2023, higher than the initial construction demand forecast of between $27 billion and $32 billion.  BCA attributed this to higher tender prices, expediting of contract awards for several private residential projects and ramping up of public housing projects. In 2024, the public sector is expected to contribute about 55 per cent of total demand, with $18 billion to $21 billion worth of contracts likely to be awarded, BCA said. These include several upcoming major public sector projects such as new Build-To-Order flats, contracts for phase two of the Cross Island MRT Line, infrastructure works for Changi Airport Terminal 5, Tuas Port developments, and major road and drainage improvement works. Private sector demand is expected to contribute between $14 billion and $17 billion in 2024, National Development Minister Desmond Lee said at the Built Environment and Property Prospects seminar organised by BCA and the Real Estate Developers’ Association of Singapore. BCA said this demand will come mainly from residential developments under the Government Land Sales programme, expansion of the two integrated resorts and redevelopment of commercial premises, as well as the development of mixed-used properties and industrial facilities. From 2025 to 2028, the projected annual construction demand is expected to be between $31 billion and $38 billion per year, Mr Lee said. The public sector is expected to contribute $19 billion to $23 billion per year during this period, with about 70 per cent for building projects and 30 per cent for civil infrastructure works. Major developments will include phase three of the Cross Island Line and the Downtown Line extension to Sungei Kadut, the redevelopment of Alexandra Hospital, a new integrated hospital in Bedok and the redevelopment of various junior colleges, said BCA. Private sector construction demand is expected to remain stable in the medium term as well, at between $12 billion and $15 billion per year from 2025 to 2028, BCA added.  In his speech, Mr Lee said the Government has been transforming the built environment sector by emphasising higher productivity and sustainability standards.  Other efforts include a move towards collaborative contracting, which provides a framework that allocates risk more equitably so that the sector can withstand emerging challenges. “For example, we have introduced clauses that allow contractors to recover part of the additional costs that arise due to pandemics,” he said. Mr Lee announced at the seminar that the Government, in collaboration with industry associations and consultancy firms, has completed a review of the Standard Consultancy Agreement (SCA).  The agreement is a common contract for public sector construction-related consultancy tenders in areas such as architectural consultancy, civil and structural engineering, and project management. The enhancements that stemmed from the review aim to foster healthier practices between public sector developers and consultants by focusing on three key outcomes: Clearer definition of scope of services, fair and timely remuneration with the ability to request fee adjustments, and a more balanced allocation of risk, Mr Lee said. He added that the Government will be enhancing the Quality Fee Method (QFM) framework for public sector consultancy tenders to place greater emphasis on quality. The enhancements include more merit-based shortlisting and increased differentiation in quality scores.  The proposed amendments to the SCA and QFM enhancements are expected to be implemented later in 2024. From April 1, 2025, government entities that handle procurement will assess consultants involved in public sector projects on their performance every six months, and give them a performance score out of 100 points, BCA said. Firms will be temporarily suspended from tendering for public sector projects for three months if their half-yearly performance score is below 50 points, which translates to a “poor” performance.  Mr Lee also urged private developers to play a bigger role in transforming the built environment sector, such as adapting the public sector’s standard provisions for collaborative contracting.  “Some of these moves may seem challenging initially as they incur higher costs, and stakeholders throughout the value chain will need time to make process adjustments. However, transformation is crucial in the long term. It will ultimately result in a more resilient, dynamic and innovative sector, which will benefit you down the road,” he said.

2,"SINGAPORE – Businesses in Singapore have pulled through a challenging economic environment, keeping their financial positions intact even as growth slowed and interest rates rose, said the central bank in a report on Nov 27.","The report also stated that companies in the financial sector – which includes banks, investment firms and insurers – have maintained strong balance sheets through multiple shocks over the past year. But risks from higher interest rates, tighter financial conditions and geopolitical uncertainty remain elevated, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said in its latest edition of the Financial Stability Review 2023. As borrowing costs rose, most companies opted to cut their debts to levels where their cash flow could support repayments, MAS said. To manage the rising cost of borrowing, many companies also deployed interest rate hedging – a financial solution that allows borrowers to swap a variable interest rate for a fixed rate over a defined period of time, thus increasing their ability to meet their obligations in a timely manner.   Firms continued to have adequate liquidity buffers even as they deployed cash reserves built up during the Covid-19 pandemic to reduce interest expenses.  The corporate sector also moderated borrowings in currencies other than the Singapore dollar, easing some of the foreign currency mismatch risk – which refers to how a change in the exchange rate will affect future income and expenditure flows. While financial ratios of externally oriented firms have stayed stronger than those of domestically oriented businesses, MAS warned that externally oriented firms remain generally more vulnerable to the risk of a global economic slowdown. “The outlook for the Singapore economy is heavily dependent on external demand conditions, which continue to be weighed down by higher-for-longer global interest rates and geopolitical uncertainties,” the central bank said. Hence, the challenging external macro-financial environment could continue to place pressure on firms’ profitability and debt servicing ability. However, MAS said its stress tests – a computer-simulated technique to analyse how borrowers would fare in drastic economic scenarios – suggest that most firms have adequate buffers to manage earnings and interest rate shocks. “There is, though, a segment of corporates that are highly leveraged with weaker cash reserves that are at greater risk,” it said. Singapore’s economy lost momentum after a strong recovery in 2021 when it grew 8.9 per cent. As inflation rose worldwide in 2022, central banks hiked interest rates to control it and, in the process, weighed down economic growth.  The Republic’s economy grew 3.6 per cent in 2022 and is now set to post growth of around 1 per cent in 2023, according to the latest forecast of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Interest rates in Singapore, as measured by the three-month compounded Singapore Overnight Rate Average, rose to more than 3.5 per cent in the second half of 2023, from less than half a per cent in the first half of 2022.  “In the coming year, SGD (Singapore dollar) interest rates are likely to remain at elevated levels based on market forward pricing,” MAS said.  But despite the challenging global and local economic environments, the central bank said domestic financial conditions have remained relatively stable over the past year.  Financial conditions refer to the ease of money and credit flow through the economy via financial markets. Higher interest rates generally lead to tighter or worsening financial conditions, which would mean less money and credit are available for companies and households.  However, MAS said firms in Singapore, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), retained access to credit even as lending conditions moderately tightened in recent quarters.  Banks also continued to onboard SME borrowers, with the number of customers rising at a steady annual pace of nearly 5 per cent in June 2023, the central bank said.  In capital markets, the Straits Times Index was marginally higher at 3,238.1 points in the third quarter, compared with the fourth quarter of 2019 when it was at 3,188.7 points.  Even as borrowing costs rose and profitability weakened amid slower economic growth, the probability of default for listed firms and corporate non-performing loan (NPL) ratios remained at relatively low levels.  Meanwhile, the yield premium paid by Singapore investment-grade corporate bonds over sovereign debt of the same maturity has narrowed since the third quarter of 2022. Yet the premium, also referred to as spread, has remained above pre-Covid-19 levels, MAS said. A stress test conducted by MAS showed that most Singapore Exchange-listed companies are resilient against a joint shock from lower demand and higher interest rates, such as a 10 per cent decline in earnings and a 3 per cent rise in interest rates from levels in the second quarter.  Looking forward, the central bank warned that the challenging economic and financial environment will continue to pose downside risks for companies with high levels of debt.  While business sentiment in the manufacturing and services sectors has improved slightly over the past year, according to business expectation surveys, the outlook is subject to considerable risks from a potentially prolonged high interest rate environment and geopolitical conflicts, it said. If debt repayment capabilities of borrowers weaken, banks could face higher credit costs.  However, banks in Singapore have remained resilient over the past year, with strong capital and liquidity positions supported by healthy profits, even as demand for loans fell.  MAS said the Industry-Wide Stress Test 2023 exercise affirmed that banks have adequate capital and liquidity buffers to weather potential downside risks arising from severe macro-financial stresses.  With tight monetary policy dampening credit demand, the risk that borrowers will not be able to service their interest payments has, in fact, subsided.  Accordingly, a survey of banks in September 2023 indicated that while loan demand from corporates had fallen over the past year, banks expect corporate loan demand to bottom out and remain relatively flat going into 2024.  “Indeed, MAS’ econometric work shows that the current weakness in credit is in line with the slowdown in economic activity and higher interest rates,” the central bank said.  While NPLs have remained low, there are early signs of potential asset quality deterioration – which refers to a decline in the value or creditworthiness of assets held by borrowers.  “To manage this risk, banks continue to maintain adequate provisioning against a potential decline in credit quality,” said MAS.",straitstimes,Financials,Singapore
3,"SINGAPORE - Simultaneous crises in two of the world’s major shipping canals have caused delays, raised costs and disrupted supply chains – and the effects were seen in a slowdown in Singapore’s logistics growth in December 2023.","The Singapore Logistics Growth Index (LGI) dipped by 0.9 point to 52.4 points that month, from 53.3 points the month before. The related transport capacity index fell to 51.9 in December, from 53.6 in November. Published by the Logistics Institute of Singapore, the index is based on data compiled from surveying logistics professionals and managements in more than 1,000 companies. The institute’s report on Jan 15 attributed the drop to slower expansion rates in the indexes of transportation and warehousing, a slower contraction in the employment index, and a faster expansion in the indexes for business volume and inventory. Mr Stephen Poh, director-general of the Logistics Institute of Singapore, said: “The latest LGI readings indicate rising logistics costs of the global economy. The Red Sea shipping crisis has caused sharp increases in shipping costs and delivery delays.” Drewry’s World Container Index rose 15 per cent to US$3,072 (S$4,110) per 40-foot container week on week to reach its highest level since October 2022. The cost is 116 per cent higher than the pre-pandemic (2019) average of US$1,420. BMI, the financial research arm of Fitch Solutions, said the Asia-Europe corridor will face the most acute delays, given the scarcity of viable alternatives to the essential Suez Canal.
 BMI noted that the fastest, typical Asia-Europe route through the Suez Canal takes 25 to 30 days. The alternative route, which wends round the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, adds around 10 days.
 Houthi rebels in Yemen began attacking commercial shipping in the Red Sea in mid-November 2023 in a series of pirate raids, unmanned aerial vehicle and missile attacks. Following these attacks, transit trade through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, which links the Red Sea with the Indian Ocean, plunged 42.6 per cent from 5.2 million tonnes on Dec 1, 2023, to 2.8 million tonnes on Jan 8, 2024. This represented a “substantial re-routing of trade in just over a month”, noted BMI. It added that the Red Sea crisis will have a “domino effect” on other shipping routes and key global manufacturing supply chains if the situation is not resolved soon – and already, Asia-US shipping costs have also begun to spike.
 For Asia-US trade, the major alternative route through the Panama Canal has not been smooth sailing either.
 The Panama Canal has faced drought for months as a result of a strong El Nino weather phenomenon sending water levels down, although rains could improve the situation there in January.
 Mr Poh of the Logistics Institute of Singapore said: “Global supply chains face supply disruptions and high fulfilment costs, not only brought about by the Red Sea crisis, but also by the drought conditions in the Panama Canal.” BMI said the Red Sea situation “compounds disruptions” at the Panama Canal as some ocean carriers had already rerouted trade through the Suez Canal, away from the Panama Canal, since the second half of 2023. The journey to the US East Coast via the Suez Canal takes around 35 days, with the Cape of Good Hope detour adding 10 to 14 days, and the alternate route through the Panama Canal five to 15 days. Mr Poh told The Business Times that the Red Sea crisis has “aggravated” logistics costs and there is now an increased uncertainty over the continued growth of the global economy. He predicted it would take several months to resolve, pointing out that prolonged conflict would escalate inflation and the disruption to supply chains.
