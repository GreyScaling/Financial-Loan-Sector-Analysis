H1 FY2023 vs H1 FY2022
The Property Development segment registered a robust 27% YoY revenue growth, reaching RM1.3 billion as compared to RM1.0 billion last year. The segment’s resilient performance was largely due to a combination of stronger sales and profit contribution from both industrial and residential products. Concurrently, PBT reflected a 6% increment, translating to RM204.2 million, reflecting the increased in on-site development activities in Bandar Bukit Raja, Nilai Impian, Elmina Business Park, and Serenia City townships.
The IAM segment’s revenue was also higher at RM52.5 million in H1 FY2023 driven by growth in retail sub-segment specifically KL East Mall which recorded an increase in occupancy rate from 81% to 86%. However, its PBT was lower at RM7.5 million from RM27.2 million, mainly due to a higher share of loss from joint ventures.
H1 FY2023 Launches and Sales
As the nation’s leading property developer, Sime Darby Property continues to build on its strengths specifically on its successful and thriving townships, which are strategically positioned to offer best-in-class products with functional layouts and excellent amenities. During the first half of FY2023, the Group unveiled new projects valued at RM2.1 billion, which represents 70% of our full year launch target of RM3.0 billion. The offerings were diversified to meet market needs: 49% in residential landed, 30% in residential high-rise, 18% in industrial and 3% in commercial. The overall take-up rate of all products currently stood at 82%.
As at 20 August 2023, residential landed products recorded an average take-up rate of 80%. Emilia Phase 1 and 2 in Nilai reported impressive take-up rates of 100% and 98%, respectively.
The residential high-rise products reported an average take-up of 73% on the heels of two launches, namely Teja in Subang Jaya City Centre (“SJCC”) and Serasi Residences in Putra Heights, at the tail end of H1 FY2023.
The Group’s industrial products achieved an average take-up rate of 88%, with contributions mainly from The Prestige Collection Signature Factories in Elmina Business Park and industrial offerings in Bandar Universiti Pagoh – both fully sold. Similarly, XME Business Park Phase 2C in Nilai Impian recorded a 94% take-up.
 
Financial and Operational Achievements
Completed inventories reduced significantly to RM237.7 million from RM277.2 million as at 31 December 2022, the lowest level ever achieved since its demerger. The Group registered cash reserves of RM795.4 million, while net gearing ratio of 20.7% reflects strong cashflow and capacity for future expansion.
The Group posted higher unbilled sales of RM3.8 billion as at 30 June 2023, versus RM3.6 billion as at 31 December 2022 ensuring revenue visibility for the next three years. Current bookings stood at RM1.9 billion as at 6 August 2023.

Kuala Lumpur, 5 February 2024 – CapitaLand Malaysia REIT Management Sdn. Bhd.

Bhd.  The agreed value of RM27.0 million, negotiated on a willing-buyer willing-seller basis, is in line with the independent market valuation1 of RM28.2 million commissioned by the Trustee. 
 
Marks entry into the high-technology manufacturing sector of the industrial market and further diversifies geographical footprint to Johor

Johor, particularly Iskandar Malaysia, is an attractive investment destination within the manufacturing sector of the industrial market.  With its competitive land and labour costs, Iskandar Malaysia has successfully attracted many high-tech and capital-intensive companies to base their operations there, supported by the Johor state government’s business-friendly policies. 
Developed by Nusajaya Tech Park Sdn. Bhd.2, Nusajaya Tech Park is a 210-hectare integrated industrial development located at Gerbang Nusajaya in Iskandar Malaysia, Johor.  Designed to accommodate a wide range of light to medium industries, it is home to multinational corporations and leading local enterprises from various industries, including aerospace, automotive electronics, precision engineering, IT, e-commerce and data centres.  Strategically located within minutes from the Malaysia-Singapore Second Link Expressway, Nusajaya Tech Park offers seamless connectivity to a network of international airports and seaports in both Singapore and Malaysia.  This prime location ensures efficient transportation and enables easy access to global markets for businesses operating in the park.

 
Strengthens income stability of the enlarged portfolio
The Subject Properties consist of two (2) semi-detached factories and one (1) detached factory, with mezzanine offices and guard posts.  The factories were completed about seven years ago and feature a sleek, modern frontage with separate loading areas.  With an efficient layout and column-free space, the building specifications of the Subject Properties include high floor loading and high ceilings.
With a collective built-up area of 74,142 square feet, the Subject Properties are fully leased to two reputable tenants in the optics and medical sectors, with a weighted average lease to expiry (WALE) of 5.2 years by rental income. The six-year lease terms with built-in rent escalations ranging between 2% and 6% p.a. will provide income stability to the portfolio. 

CLMT’s portfolio will be strengthened with the addition of these high-quality industrial properties. Post-transaction, CLMT’s enlarged portfolio will consist of 10 properties with the proportion of industrial and logistics properties increasing from 10% to 11% of the total portfolio net lettable area of approximately 4.4 million square feet.

 
DPU-accretive acquisition
CLMT intends to finance the Proposed Acquisition through debt.  The Proposed Acquisition is expected to generate an annual rental income of RM2.0 million, with a first-year yield of approximately 7.3%.  It will contribute positively to CLMT’s income and is distribution per unit accretive to CLMT unitholders on a proforma basis.  The Proposed Acquisition is expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2024.







Mr Tan Choon Siang, CEO of CMRM, said: “We are pleased to embark on the acquisition of our first industrial properties in Malaysia and expand into the fast-growing state of Johor.  Nusajaya Tech Park is highly sought after by multinational corporations due to its favourable geographical location and proximity to Singapore.  In addition, Malaysia’s latest New Industrial Master Plan 2030 is set to transform and grow the country’s manufacturing sector including creating high-value job opportunities and developing new and existing clusters.  We believe that the southern region of Malaysia, particularly Iskandar Malaysia, will benefit from this initiative. It is also rapidly gaining prominence as an attractive investment destination for global players in sectors such as manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, and financial services.” 
“We are confident that the Proposed Acquisition will enable us to gain a foothold in Malaysia’s resilient industrial market and one of its largest economic hubs.  This will position CLMT for further growth in 2024 and represents a significant milestone as we accelerate our portfolio reconstitution journey, driving sustainable growth and diversifying our income sources.  As the only Malaysia-listed REIT in the CapitaLand Group, CLMT has access to a stable acquisition pipeline that will further enhance our existing portfolio.  This includes the Proposed Acquisition and the acquisition of Queensbay Mall from CapitaLand Investment in November 2022.  Looking ahead, we remain focused on pursuing growth targeting properties with stable cash flows and strong operating metrics while maintaining financial discipline.”
