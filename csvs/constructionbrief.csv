0,Strong growth for Singapore’s construction sector,"The construction sector in Singapore has grown by 6.6% since Q2 2022, led by an expansion of output in both public and private sectors, according to a market report from Global construction consultant, Linesight. With the exception of manufacturing, all other construction sectors experienced growth. Construction output is expected to expand by 5.4% in real terms in 2023, with this growth being driven by investments in renewable energy, transport, housing and industrial projects. The sector still faces challenges, such as high interest rates and labour shortages. Although the job vacancy rate in the construction sector decreased to 2.4% in Q1 2023 from 4.5% in Q1 2022, it remains almost twice as high as pre-Covid levels. According to the report, the sector is adopting digital technologies and fostering a collaborative approach to navigate these challenges. There is a continued focus by the Building Construction Authority (BCA) on sustainable practices and the authority is implementing regulations related to use of prefabrication elements, decarbonisation, redevelopment and environmental protection and management at construction sites. A key construction market in Singapore is the building of data centres. According to the report, Singapore data centres had a market value of US$1.6 billion in 2021 which is projected to grow at a 5-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16%.",constructionbrief,Construction,Singapore
1,Singapore’s construction sector to grow 5.4% in 2023,"Global construction consultancy, Linesight, has released new research indicating the levelling of prices in key commodities in the first quarter of 2023. While the industry continues to face challenges such as labour shortages and elevated prices for certain materials, conditions are improving and the industry is expected to regain momentum in the medium to long term. The company says that Singapore’s economic growth is forecast to slow in 2023, however the construction industry is expected to grow at 5.4%, due largely to planned public housing projects.  The strengthening of global demand coupled with China’s reopening has led to volatile copper prices that rose sharply by 11.2% from Q4 2022 to Q1 2023. Linesight adds that domestic prices will continue to come under pressure as a result of demand pressures from public infrastructure development projects under Singapore’s Green Plan 2030.  Following an increase in the first half of last year, cement prices have remained elevated, held up by high production costs and improving demand. The global construction consultancy says that prices are expected to rise marginally in Q2 2023, as construction activity begins to pick up. In addition, steel prices declined in the first quarter of 2023 by 6.2% for steel rebar and 1.5% for flat steel. Steel prices are said to be set to pick up again buoyed by rising demand, with the commencement of works on a number of large civil engineering projects and increased demand from China.   Michael Murphy, Director at Linesight Singapore, said, “Whilst some elevated material prices pose a challenge in the short term, improving market conditions are setting the stage for the construction sector to get back on track. “As confidence among industry players builds, there has also been increasing appetite for greener and modern construction methods, such as prefabrication, to align with Singapore’s sustainable development agenda and to futureproof operations against market headwinds. To tap into the opportunities presented by the construction sector’s growth trajectory and emphasis on sustainability, having strategic partners to help navigate an evolving landscape is key.”  You can see the full report here.",constructionbrief,Construction,Singapore
