International Edition,"Southeast Asia’s third largest lender United Overseas Bank (UOB) laid out its interim and 2050 decarbonisation targets for six top polluting sectors on Monday. Among its wider commitments, it pledged to stop financing upstream oil and gas projects approved for development after 2022, the first bank in Asia to do so. Net-zero targets for five other sectors, including power, automotive, real estate, construction and steel, were unveiled. The six sectors make up 60 per cent of the bank’s corporate lending portfolio, and are seen as critical to emissions reduction. Upstream oil and gas activities generally include raw material drilling, extraction and production, while downstream projects involve post-production processes. Speaking at a press conference held on the same day of the announcement, Eric Lim, UOB’s chief sustainability officer, said that its commitment with regards to the oil and gas sector is in line with calls from international bodies such as the United Nations-backed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency, that the world cease development of new fossil fuel resources. The bank, which said in 2019 that it had stopped funding coal-fired power plants, now also commits to extend this to the entire thermal coal sector by 2039 – the same year that rival DBS Bank pledged to be coal-free in a declaration made last year. It now already has in place prohibitions on new project financing of greenfield or expansion of coal-fired power plants and thermal coal mines. Elaborating on the bank’s decision to cease immediate funding for new upstream oil and gas projects, a rare one in Asia as many financial institutions in the region continue to back gas development, Lim said that research conducted showed wide variance in net-zero aligned pathways for the sector. In Malaysia, for example, there are pathways suggesting a reduction of financing by 39 per cent, while other pathways indicate a need to increase oil and gas financing by as much as 59 per cent, and all these were globally-accepted pathways. “What that told us was, within the region, we have not, as a collective community, figured out the most effective way towards transitioning out of oil and gas in a way that countries can execute,” he said. UOB, hence, has decided that it would “make the strongest commitment it knows how to make, which is that of limiting new supply,” said Lim, adding that the bank will continue to work with regional and national stakeholders to figure out “the right oil and gas pathways” that can truly support decarbonisation. According to statistics provided in its latest trading update, as of September 30, outstanding loans to the oil and gas industries make up 4 per cent of UOB’s total loans. Its exposure is largely to downstream traders which are mainly national oil companies and global firms, with S$9.3 billion (US$6.6 billion) in outstanding loans being made to these players. S$2.4 billion (US$1.7 billion) in outstanding loans are to upstream industries. UOB did not disclose additional statistics on the status of its portfolios for coal, oil and gas, as well as renewables, when probed, though Lim highlights a metric for avoided greenhouse gas emissions that the bank looks at, which reflects how its solar financing portfolio has contributed to emissions reductions. “The pace at which sustainable financing is growing compared to financing of activities of the old economy is also growing, multiple times faster,” he said. UOB laid out interim and 2050 targets to reduce emission intensity across six sectors on Monday.

Image: UOB UOB is the second bank in the region to set out emission targets to meet its net-zero commitments by 2050 after DBS made a similar announcement last month. The pledges reflect how financial institutions in Southeast Asia are pushing ahead with decarbonisation goals, despite weakened resolve among the world’s biggest banks to commit to a net-zero future. According to reports, major banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley are considering leaving the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), a coalition of about 500 financial sector entities. The moves have been characterised by the media as banks “quiet quitting” on net zero, as misgivings towards strict legal requirements increase, and institutions worry that they may have jumped on the bandwagon too soon, especially as oil and gas are experiencing a market resurgence. For UOB, it has laid out targets to reduce emissions intensity across the energy and built environment ecosystems by between 20 and 61 per cent by 2030, and 85 and 100 per cent by 2050, against a 2021 baseline. The six sectors identified are most material to emissions reduction, said UOB, and they make up 60 per cent of the bank’s corporate lending portfolio. Image: UOB Emissions intensity is measured differently for each sector, and are measured against per unit of economic output or activity. UOB said that it wants to “support economic growth with the lowest carbon footprint possible”. The bank pledged to conduct annual reporting to track progress against its commitments. It will expand the scope of its targets to include additional sectors, for example agriculture, as data and climate scenarios become available. It also will join the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, a UN-supported coalition, as well as GFANZ Asia Pacific. Commenting on global developments, particularly tough economic circumstances in Europe that have led to companies letting their environmental priorities slip, Lim said that in Asia, the situation is different, and central banks in the region, including in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, are starting to become more aggressive in pursuing net-zero goals. “There is recognition in the long run that we need to continue to support our decarbonisation efforts in this part of the world. We don’t see a pullback here. Even if you talk to hard-to-abate sectors, the writing on the wall is clear – we have to move towards net-zero,” he said. In a briefing note published last week, financial analytics firm S&P Global said that Singapore’s biggest lenders are doubling down on sustainable finance transactions, as they seek to support the government’s bid to become a green finance hub for Southeast Asia. The nation state recently committed to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Wee Ee Cheong, deputy chairman and chief executive of UOB, who was present at the conference, emphasised the importance of an orderly and just transition within the regional context, and said that banks need to double down on transition financing to support their clients. “It will be a challenging journey for businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises. For example, they lack resources to collect environmental, social and governance (ESG) data. It is even more complex if the companies operate in multiple markets.” Your support helps keep our journalism independent and our content free for everyone to read.

ICLG - Oil & Gas Laws and Regulations -,"Singapore Chapter covers common issues in oil and gas laws and regulations – including development of oil and natural gas, import/export of natural gas, LNG, import/export of oil, transportation, transmission and distribution and foreign investment.  ICLG.com > Practice Areas > Oil & Gas Regulation > Singapore         1.1        A brief outline of your jurisdiction’s natural gas sector, including a general description of: natural gas reserves; natural gas production including the extent to which production is associated or non-associated natural gas; import and export of natural gas, including liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) liquefaction and export facilities, and/or receiving and re-gasification facilities (“LNG facilities”); natural gas pipeline transportation and distribution/transmission network; natural gas storage; and commodity sales and trading. Natural gas plays a significant role in meeting Singapore’s energy needs.  The share of natural gas in Singapore’s electricity generation fuel mix has increased significantly from 19% in 2000 to 94.9% in 2021, as gas-fired generators have replaced the oil-fired generators previously in use.  Singapore is a net importer of natural gas and does not produce or export natural gas.  Singapore does not have any known natural gas reserves.  Most of Singapore’s natural gas is imported from Indonesia and Malaysia through pipelines.  Singapore also imports liquified natural gas. The main players in the natural gas industry in Singapore include: The Energy Market Authority of Singapore (EMA) is the regulatory authority responsible for supervising the Singapore gas industry. 1.2        To what extent are your jurisdiction’s energy requirements met using natural gas (including LNG)? Please see the response to question 1.1. 1.3        To what extent are your jurisdiction’s natural gas requirements met through domestic natural gas production? Singapore does not have any known natural gas reserves. 1.4        To what extent is your jurisdiction’s natural gas production exported (pipeline or LNG)? Singapore does not have any known natural gas reserves. 2.1        Please provide a brief outline of your jurisdiction’s oil sector. Singapore is one of Asia’s major oil refining centres and trading hubs, with significant infrastructure for oil refining, storage and distribution.  Singapore does not have any known oil reserves. 2.2        To what extent are your jurisdiction’s energy requirements met using oil? In 2021, petroleum products, mainly in the form of diesel and fuel oil, accounted for 1.0% of Singapore’s electricity generation fuel mix. 2.3        To what extent are your jurisdiction’s oil requirements met through domestic oil production? Singapore does not have any known oil reserves. 2.4        To what extent is your jurisdiction’s oil production exported? Based on statistics published by the EMA, the bulk of energy imports and exports are petroleum products.  In 2021, these formed 60.3% of Singapore’s energy imports and 98.3% of energy exports while crude oil formed 32.2% and 1.7% of energy imports and exports, respectively. 3.1        Outline broadly the legal/statutory and organisational framework for the exploration and production (“development”) of oil and natural gas reserves including: principal legislation; in whom the State’s mineral rights to oil and natural gas are vested; Government authority or authorities responsible for the regulation of oil and natural gas development; and current major initiatives or policies of the Government (if any) in relation to oil and natural gas development. Singapore does not have any known oil or natural gas reserves. 3.2        How are the State’s mineral rights to develop oil and natural gas reserves transferred to investors or companies (“participants”) (e.g., licence, concession, service contract, contractual rights under Production Sharing Agreement?) and what is the legal status of those rights or interests under domestic law? Singapore does not have any known oil or natural gas reserves. 3.3        If different authorisations are issued in respect of different stages of development (e.g., exploration appraisal or production arrangements), please specify those authorisations and briefly summarise the most important (standard) terms (such as term/duration, scope of rights, expenditure obligations). Singapore does not have any known oil or natural gas reserves. 3.4        To what extent, if any, does the State have an ownership interest, or seek to participate, in the development of oil and natural gas reserves (whether as a matter of law or policy)? Singapore does not have any known oil or natural gas reserves. 3.5        How does the State derive value from oil and natural gas development (e.g., royalty, share of production, taxes)? Singapore does not have any known oil or natural gas reserves. 3.6        Are there any restrictions on the export of production? Singapore does not have any known oil or natural gas reserves. 3.7        Are there any currency exchange restrictions, or restrictions on the transfer of funds derived from production out of the jurisdiction? Singapore does not have any known oil or natural gas reserves. 3.8        What restrictions (if any) apply to the transfer or disposal of oil and natural gas development rights or interests? Singapore does not have any known oil or natural gas reserves. 3.9        Are participants obliged to provide any security or guarantees in relation to oil and natural gas development? Singapore does not have any known oil or natural gas reserves. 3.10      Can rights to develop oil and natural gas reserves granted to a participant be pledged for security, or booked for accounting purposes under domestic law? Singapore does not have any known oil or natural gas reserves. 3.11      In addition to those rights/authorisations required to explore for and produce oil and natural gas, what other principal Government authorisations are required to develop oil and natural gas reserves (e.g., environmental, occupational health and safety) and from whom are these authorisations to be obtained? Singapore does not have any known oil or natural gas reserves. 3.12      Is there any legislation or framework relating to the abandonment or decommissioning of physical structures used in oil and natural gas development? If so, what are the principal features/requirements of the legislation? Singapore does not have any known oil or natural gas reserves. 3.13      Is there any legislation or framework relating to gas storage? If so, what are the principal features/requirements of the legislation? There is no specific law or regulation dealing with gas storage.  General environmental, health and safety requirements may apply. 3.14      Are there any laws or regulations that deal specifically with the exploration and production of unconventional oil and gas resources? If so, what are their key features? There is no specific law or regulation dealing with the exploration and production of oil and gas reserves.  Singapore does not have any known oil or natural gas reserves. 3.15      What has been the impact, if any, of the “energy transition” on the oil and gas industry in your jurisdiction, and are there any policies or laws/regulations that require the oil and gas industry to decarbonise? Are there any policies or laws/regulations relating to the development of low-carbon hydrogen and its use in conjunction with or in place of natural gas, or the development of carbon capture and storage? There is no specific law or regulation relating to decarbonisation or the development of low-carbon alternatives or “energy transition”. Singapore is working towards halving its carbon emissions to 33 MtCO2e by 2050, with a view to achieving net zero as soon as viable in the second half of this century.  This is done by transforming Singapore’s energy supply (where natural gas will continue to be a dominant fuel for Singapore’s electricity generation, while scaling up other sources of energy, such as solar, tapping on regional power grids and exploring emerging low-carbon technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture, utilisation and storage). Singapore had also passed the Energy (Resilience Measures and Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill in November 2021, which amended key energy related legislation, such as the Energy Market Authority of Singapore Act, Electricity Act and Gas Act, to enable EMA to implement policies to support the energy transition (such as to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the generation, transmission, import, export or supply of electricity), while ensuring the sustainability, security, and reliability of the power sector. 4.1        Outline any regulatory requirements, or specific terms, limitations or rules applying in respect of cross-border sales or deliveries of natural gas (including LNG). The Gas Act applies to regulate the import of gas into Singapore.  No person shall import gas into Singapore unless he is the holder of a gas importer licence. 5.1        Outline any regulatory requirements, or specific terms, limitations or rules applying in respect of cross-border sales or deliveries of oil and oil products. There are no specific regulatory requirements applicable to the import of oil and oil products into Singapore.  General environmental, health and safety requirements may apply. 6.1        Outline broadly the ownership, organisational and regulatory framework in relation to transportation pipelines and associated infrastructure (such as natural gas processing and storage facilities). The construction and operation of oil pipelines is not specifically regulated, apart from general environmental, health and safety requirements. As the sole gas transporter, PowerGas Limited is responsible under its licence for the planning, development, maintenance and operation of its onshore gas pipeline network.  It must also carry out all refurbishments and replacements of new investments in the network in accordance with the relevant statutory, licensing and other requirements. PowerGas Limited, as the sole gas transporter, has the right to install in, on, over or under any land, premises, street or waters any gas pipeline that is or will be part of its gas pipeline network, and to carry out any necessary or incidental activities. The Gas Network Code, which is implemented pursuant to the Gas Act, operates as a binding contract between PowerGas Limited and each relevant gas shipper, and establishes and governs the operation of the gas pipeline network. 6.2        What governmental authorisations (including any applicable environmental authorisations) are required to construct and operate oil and natural gas transportation pipelines and associated infrastructure? Please see the response to question 6.1. 6.3        In general, how does an entity obtain the necessary land (or other) rights to construct oil and natural gas transportation pipelines or associated infrastructure? Do Government authorities have any powers of compulsory acquisition to facilitate land access? Please see the response to question 6.1. 6.4        How is access to oil and natural gas transportation pipelines and associated infrastructure organised? Access to oil transportation pipelines is usually addressed by bilateral access agreements. With respect to gas pipelines, the Gas Act requires a person who owns or has control of a gas pipeline, gas pipeline network or onshore receiving facility designated by the EMA to provide access to the pipeline, network or facility without undue preference or discrimination.  A prospective user who is unable to negotiate access to the infrastructure can apply to the EMA for directions to secure rights of access to such infrastructure. In addition, if any person is unable to conclude an arrangement for the allocation of gas in any offshore gas pipeline, they may apply to the EMA, which may give directions to the applicant and every person whose gas is being conveyed through the offshore gas pipeline for a gas allocation arrangement to be made in respect of that pipeline to enter into an agreement for the allocation of gas in the offshore gas pipeline. 6.5        To what degree are oil and natural gas transportation pipelines integrated or interconnected, and how is co-operation between different transportation systems established and regulated? There is no integration or interconnection of oil and gas transportation pipelines.  PowerGas Limited, as the sole gas transporter, is responsible under its licence for the planning, development, maintenance and operation of its onshore gas pipeline network. 6.6        Outline any third-party access regime/rights in respect of oil and natural gas transportation and associated infrastructure. For example, can the regulator or a new customer wishing to transport oil or natural gas compel or require the operator/owner of an oil or natural gas transportation pipeline or associated infrastructure to grant capacity or expand its facilities in order to accommodate the new customer? If so, how are the costs (including costs of interconnection, capacity reservation or facility expansions) allocated? Please see the response to question 6.4. 6.7        Are parties free to agree the terms upon which oil or natural gas is to be transported or are the terms (including costs/tariffs which may be charged) regulated? Trade in oil and gas is usually completed under bilateral sale or supply contracts.  In relation to domestic gas contracts, the party must also apply for and obtain capacity rights from PowerGas Limited (as the sole gas transporter) to have the right to have gas transported through the gas pipeline network. 7.1        Outline broadly the ownership, organisational and regulatory framework in relation to the natural gas transmission/distribution network. Please see the response to question 6.1. 7.2        What governmental authorisations (including any applicable environmental authorisations) are required to operate a distribution network? Please see the response to question 6.1. 7.3        How is access to the natural gas distribution network organised? Please see the response to questions 6.1 and 6.4. 7.4        Can the regulator require a distributor to grant capacity or expand its system in order to accommodate new customers? Please see the response to question 6.4. 7.5        What fees are charged for accessing the distribution network, and are these fees regulated? The EMA regulates prices to be charged by a gas transporter for the conveyance of gas through a gas pipeline or gas pipeline network. 7.6        Are there any restrictions or limitations in relation to acquiring an interest in a gas utility, or the transfer of assets forming part of the distribution network (whether directly or indirectly)? Certain restrictions on controlling interests apply to a gas transporter, a gas transport agent, an LNG terminal operator and any other gas licensee declared by the Minister to be a designated gas licensee for the purposes of such provisions of the Gas Act which relate to the control of gas licensees and entities with interest in the gas pipeline network (Designated Entity).  In particular, no person (whether alone or with associates) is permitted to hold or be able to control 12% or more or 30% or more of the equity interest or voting power in a Designated Entity.  Additionally, the EMA must be notified in writing when any person becomes a substantial equity interest holder (5% or more of the equity interest or voting power) of a Designated Entity. 8.1        Outline broadly the ownership, organisational and regulatory framework in relation to natural gas trading. Please include details of current major initiatives or policies of the Government or regulator (if any) relating to natural gas trading. Please see the response to question 6.7. The EMA is in the process of developing a secondary gas trading market. 8.2        What range of natural gas commodities can be traded? For example, can only “bundled” products (i.e., the natural gas commodity and the distribution thereof) be traded? Please see the response to question 6.7. There are no specific regulatory requirements or restrictions applicable. 9.1        Outline broadly the ownership, organisational and regulatory framework in relation to LNG facilities. Under the Gas Act, no person may manage or operate any LNG terminal (being a facility located onshore or in Singapore waters which is used to receive, store or gasify LNG that is imported into Singapore and at which certain prescribed activities are carried out in relation to any LNG received at the facility) unless it holds an LNG terminal operator’s licence.  Currently Singapore LNG Corporation Pte Ltd is the only LNG Terminal Operator licensee in Singapore.  A LNG Terminal Operator licensee is subject to the provisions of the Gas Act and the conditions of the licence – this includes restrictions on controlling interests.  Please see the response to question 7.6. 9.2        What governmental authorisations are required to construct and operate LNG facilities? Please see the response to question 9.1.  General building and construction, environmental, health and safety requirements may also apply. 9.3        Is there any regulation of the price or terms of service in the LNG sector? The EMA regulates the price margin that LNG aggregators may impose to protect end-users from being subject to any potential abuse by the LNG aggregators of their dominant position. 9.4        Outline any third-party access regime/rights in respect of LNG facilities. The Singapore LNG Terminal is an open-access facility, and access is usually addressed by bilateral access agreements. 10.1      Outline broadly the regulatory framework in relation to the downstream oil sector. Singapore does not have any known natural oil reserves and does not have a specific regulatory framework relating to the downstream oil sector. 10.2      Outline broadly the ownership, organisation and regulatory framework in relation to oil trading. Singapore does not have any known natural oil reserves and does not have a specific regulatory framework relating to oil trading. 11.1      Which governmental authority or authorities are responsible for the regulation of competition aspects, or anti-competitive practices, in the oil and natural gas sector? The EMA has various powers under the Gas Act to investigate and enforce anti-competition measures in the natural gas sector. The general anti-competition regime (under the Competition Act) would apply to the oil sector (and possibly the natural gas sector), which is overseen by the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS). 11.2      To what criteria does the regulator have regard in determining whether conduct is anti-competitive? There is no prescribed criteria and general competition law principles would apply. 11.3      What power or authority does the regulator have to preclude or take action in relation to anti-competitive practices? The EMA has various powers under the Gas Act to investigate and enforce anti-competition measures in the natural gas sector, including in respect of agreements preventing, restricting or distorting competition and abuse of a dominant position.  These include powers to investigate, enter premises under warrant, give directions to bring the infringement to an end and impose a financial penalty of an amount not exceeding $1 million or 10% of the annual turnover of such person’s business in Singapore, ascertained from its latest audited accounts, whichever is the higher. The CCCS has various powers under the Competition Act in respect of anti-competition measures, including in respect of the abuse of a dominant position.  If the CCCS has made a decision that there has been an infringement of Section 47 of the Competition Act which prohibits the abuse of a dominant position, the CCCS may direct that the infringement be brought to an end (and where necessary, specify a particular course of action to eliminate the harmful effect of such infringement and to prevent the recurrence of such infringement).  Such direction by the CCCS may include, but is not limited to, requiring the person concerned to modify or cease the conduct.  The CCCS may also, under Sections 69(3) and 69(4) of the Competition Act, impose a financial penalty of up to 10% of the turnover of the business of the relevant undertaking in Singapore for each year of infringement for a period of up to a maximum of three years, if the CCCS is satisfied that the infringement has been committed intentionally or negligently. 11.4      Does the regulator (or any other Government authority) have the power to approve/disapprove mergers or other changes in control over businesses in the oil and natural gas sector, or proposed acquisitions of development assets, transportation or associated infrastructure or distribution assets? If so, what criteria and procedures are applied? How long does it typically take to obtain a decision approving or disapproving the transaction? Please see the response to question 3.6. 12.1      Are there any special requirements or limitations on acquisitions of interests in the natural gas sector (whether development, transportation or associated infrastructure, distribution or other) by foreign companies? There are no specific foreign shareholding or investment restrictions in the natural gas sector. 12.2      To what extent is regulatory policy in respect of the oil and natural gas sector influenced or affected by international treaties or other multinational arrangements? There are no specific requirements relating to international treaties and multinational arrangements under regulatory policy in the oil and natural gas sector. 13.1      Provide a brief overview of compulsory dispute resolution procedures (statutory or otherwise) applying to the oil and natural gas sector (if any), including procedures applying in the context of disputes between the applicable Government authority/regulator and: participants in relation to oil and natural gas development; transportation pipeline and associated infrastructure owners or users in relation to the transportation, processing or storage of natural gas; downstream oil infrastructure owners or users; and distribution network owners or users in relation to the distribution/transmission of natural gas. There are no compulsory dispute resolution procedures applicable to the oil sector. For the natural gas sector, there are generally no compulsory dispute resolution procedures applicable.  However, under the Gas Network Code, which operates as a binding contract between PowerGas Limited and each relevant gas shipper, and establishes and governs the operation of the gas pipeline network, certain prescribed dispute resolution procedures apply in respect of disputes arising out of or in connection with the Gas Network Code, the contract between PowerGas Limited and each relevant gas shipper or an ancillary agreement offered by PowerGas Limited and a gas shipper setting out further terms of their gas transportation arrangement. 13.2      Is your jurisdiction a signatory to, and has it duly ratified into domestic legislation: the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards; and/or the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (“ICSID”)? Singapore is a signatory to the New York Convention and ICSID. 13.3      Is there any special difficulty (whether as a matter of law or practice) in litigating, or seeking to enforce judgments or awards, against Government authorities or State organs (including any immunity)? No, civil proceedings can be commenced against government authorities in Singapore. The Gas Act also sets out certain statutory remedies.  A person aggrieved by any decision of the EMA in the exercise of any discretion vested in it by or under the Gas Act (except for certain exceptions) or any direction issued by the EMA under the Gas Act, may, except where provision has been made under the Gas Act for an appeal to be made to an Appeal Panel, appeal to the Minister, who may determine such appeal. 13.4      Have there been instances in the oil and natural gas sector when foreign corporations have successfully obtained judgments or awards against Government authorities or State organs pursuant to litigation before domestic courts? We are not aware of any past instances of such judgments or awards. 14.1      Have there been any new regulatory or policy initiatives in your jurisdiction directly in response to the recent rise in global oil and gas prices (such as price caps, subsidies or a new focus on local sources of energy)? There have not been any new regulations enacted.  In terms of policies, to enhance Singapore’s energy security and resilience, EMA put in place a set of measures in October 2021 to help ensure that Singapore’s overall gas supplies remain sufficient.  The energy security measures have been extended until 31 March 2023.  These measures include: 14.2      Please provide, in no more than 300 words, a summary of any new cases, trends and developments in Oil and Gas Regulation Law in your jurisdiction (other than anything already discussed above).

Credits: Unsplash,"Earlier in June 2019, both Shell and ExxonMobil made important announcements, boosting confidence in Singaporeâs oil & gas (O&G) industry. ExxonMobil completed a 2-year expansion at its Singapore refinery in Jurong, while Shell increased its storage capacity at its Singapore Bukom refinery. A unit of Rex International, Lime Petroleum AS, also announced an agreement to acquire 30% of 2 drilling licenses in the Norwegian Sea. We have also seen reports of long-term charters for offshore-support vessels by majors and Engineering, Procurement & Construction (EPC) companies - fleet utilization seems to be improving although charter rates remain depressed. This is consistent with our conversations with various market participants, as well as observations from public filings of listed groups. What do these developments mean for SME business owners in the O&G/marine industries? We think that these could be signs that the industry is picking up and we believe that some financial institutions are noticing the increased activity as well. â â The above reasons make it challenging for relationship managers to evaluate the sustainability of the business, build confidence about customer repayments, and most importantly, to convince their credit committees. â â Fortunately, with the industry restructuring in its fifth year, prospects in 2019 for the âsurvivorsâ do not seem as bleak as compared to a couple of years ago. While the banks are still extremely cautious, some financial institutions are taking the lead in financing SMEs in this industry: In simple terms, a factoring arrangement involves a financial institution buying over invoices and collecting payment directly from the buyers. This allows the SME to unlock funds from its receivables to finance other transactions. The best part of such a structure is that the financing limit can usually grow quickly alongside the business volume of the SME. While the process can be cumbersome, we usually advise SMEs to use factoring facilities to complement other term loans that they may have. It is a good way to get the financing tap flowing again. These short-term facilities usually run between 1-6 months and rates may range from 1% to 5% per month (i.e. 12% to 60% per annum). Processing fees range from 2% to 5% of the amount disbursed. We would caution against using such loans to finance ongoing business since they are expensive, but if you have a small short-term financing gap to bridge, these loans can be very handy. Finally, if you have hard assets such as property or equipment, there are financiers in the market that will be able to unlock varying percentages (typically 50% to 80%) of the value by providing working capital loans secured by these assets. Rates range from 5.5% to 10% per annum, depending on the type and nature of the assets. â â Lendingpot operates a FREE business loan marketplace that connects SMEs to multiple lenders with only one application. These are only some of our lenders. The Business Loan Marketplace is completely free; we donât even take commissions from financial institutions in order to keep true to our promise to bring the best value and benefit the SMEs. â Lendingpot.sg operates a Business Loan Marketplace that allows an SME to connect to multiple lenders with just one application, allowing the SME to know who its prospective lenders are and the rates that they offer, in a very short time. â â  Lendingpot is Singapore's leading digital loan marketplace with a diverse network of 45 lenders to match your business funding needs.",lendingpot_sg.txt,Oil and Gas,Singapore
This content is no longer being updated.,"Singapore’s banks are funding a huge problemHow exposed are Singaporean banks to unburnable carbon?OCBC is Singapore’s dirtiest bankMore dirty deals in the pipelineWhy are Singapore’s banks fuelling the fire?Conclusion January 2018 If the world is to have an 80% chance of meeting its agreed goal of keeping global warming to below 2ºC, then 80% of fossil fuels worldwide must remain in the ground according to independent financial think tank Carbon Tracker. Yet despite pledges to take action on climate change, banks continue to fund the expansion of the fossil fuel industry. Failure to keep a lid on global warming would be an environmental and humanitarian disaster, but the economic impact would also be enormous. As Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England has repeatedly warned, investors face “potentially huge” losses from climate change action that could make vast reserves of oil, coal and gas “literally unburnable”. As the world moves to limit global warming, trillions of dollars of fossil fuel assets are at risk in the impending ‘carbon bubble’ according to Carbon Tracker’s founder Mark Campanale. Singapore’s 3 major banks – Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC), DBS Bank and United Overseas Bank (UOB) – are highly active overseas project finance investors in Asia Pacific and globally. Yet these banks seem to fly under the radar of studies examining dirty lending practices, lack of climate policy and failure to adopt industry standards such as the Equator Principles. Market Forces analysed data from IJGlobal, a leading online energy and infrastructure finance data service, relating to OCBC, DBS Bank and UOB’s lending to coal companies and projects since 2012. 22 deals worth US$2.41 billion were included in the analysis. 13 deals for coal-fired power stations totalled $1,409 million, while five coal port deals were worth $630 million and four focused on coal mining worth $372 million. Paiton Power Station, Indonesia. Funded by DBS. (Photo by CEphoto, Uwe Aranas) OCBC has participated in 14 coal deals since 2012, lending $1,142 million: DBS Bank participated in 13 deals worth $1,007 million since 2012, five of which also involved OCBC: United Overseas Bank participated in five deals worth $262 million since 2012, all of which involved at least one other Singaporean bank: Of all the deals, the vast majority (19) consisted of finance for coal projects (known as project finance) whilst three financed companies (corporate finance). Eight deals consisted of newly established lending for the construction of seven coal-fired power projects. Ten deals were ‘refinancings’, whereby lenders renew existing debt for companies or projects that have typically already been built or are under construction. Three deals financed acquisitions of coal assets and one was additional debt to an existing project. The World Bank president, Jim Yong Kim, remarked last year that “if Vietnam goes forward with 40 GW of coal, if the entire region implements the coal-based plans right now, I think we are finished.” Despite this, DBS Bank has been named as part of a syndicate in three 1200MW coal-fired power plants in Vietnam – Nam Dinh 1, Nghi Son 2, and Vung Ang 2. OCBC is also involved in Nghi Son 2. Unless DBS moves to withdraw from these deals or institute a policy to restrict lending to coal power stations, as many other banks have around the world, it could find itself at the head of Singapore’s dirtiest banks. DBS is also a financial adviser for a number of planned coal-fired plants in Indonesia including the Jawa-6 (2000MW), Jawa-9 (1000MW) and Jawa-10 (1000MW) plants. Vung Ang 1 power station, Vietnam. DBS is involved in funding the 1,200MW Vung Ang 2 expansion. “Climate change is among the most pressing challenges of our time, and one that needs to be tackled urgently if we are to preserve the habitability of our planet. As a bank focused on ensuring sustainable development across Asia, we believe it is imperative that we contribute towards the fight against global warming by examining and reducing our own environmental footprint.” -Mike Power, Chief Operating Officer for Technology and Operations, DBS Bank, and co-chair of the bank’s Sustainability Council DBS in particular is outspoken on the need to take climate action. Unfortunately its rhetoric is not matched by action. The reality is that Singaporean banks’ policies are significantly weaker than their European and US peers. Analysis of commercial banks funding the expansion of coal-fired power globally, published in December by BankTrack, scored the coal power lending policies of 42 banks. The report did not consider DBS Bank, OCBC or United Overseas Bank so BankTrack retrospectively scored these institutions at Market Forces’ request. BankTrack found that, compared to their contemporaries in Europe and the US, the Singapore banks performed poorly. Singapore’s banks scored ‘D’ or ‘D-’ compared with mostly ‘B’ and ‘C’ grades for European and US banks (see scores below). A ‘D’ score indicates the bank employs ‘enhanced due diligence that applies to coal power,’ whereas ‘D-’ indicates a ‘general due diligence commitment’. In stark comparison to the Singaporean banks, BankTrack also found that 14 banks globally, all from the US and Europe, have ended direct financing of new coal plants worldwide. Additionally, unlike 92 of their global peers from 37 countries, none of the Singapore banks have adopted the Equator Principles, which provide a minimum standard for due diligence in financing projects such as coal power plants. Whilst it must be noted that renewable investments and pledges from Singaporean banks are a positive sign, the reality is that unless funding and support of polluting energy sources such as coal declines rapidly, this will not keep the world below two degrees of warming. Banks justify coal investments by rightly pointing out that communities need energy. However, with a rapidly improving economic outlook for wind and solar, including renewable energy already being cheaper than coal in many countries, investments in coal power serve little more than the companies seeking to build their old, dirty technology. Coal power also delivers costly ‘externalities’. In terms of air pollution alone, peer reviewed research from Harvard University published in January estimated that, by 2030, pollution related to coal will contribute to 19,220 deaths annually in Vietnam. Singapore positions itself as a global leader in terms of sustainability, yet its banks remain wedded to outdated, dirty energy. It’s time for change.

This deal took advantage of the recent drop in global interest rates. Both banks are currently seeking to syndicate the loan to a wider network of banks across Asia. The five-year loan was secured at about 125 basis points above the corresponding benchmark secured overnight financing rate (SOFR). ONGC Videsh is paying around 4.91% interest for the loan, as the five-year SOFR is currently at 3.66%. DBS, the lead arranger, confirmed that the bankers are looking for syndication opportunities across Asia. BoB has yet to reply to an email seeking comment, however, an ONGC Videsh spokesperson stated that the loan is a refinance for a previously taken loan. This loan is guaranteed by the parent ONGC, with DBS as the lead arranger with USD 300 million and BoB providing USD 120 million. It is hoped that ONGC Videsh’s sovereign backing and India’s emergence as the fastest-growing large economy in the world will lead to strong demand for the loan. Last August, the government gave ONGC Videsh the ‘navratna’ status, allowing it to undertake capital expenditure without any ceiling and to raise debt from domestic and international markets with approval from the government and Reserve Bank of India (RBI). In line with its parent and the sovereign, Fitch affirmed ONGC Videsh’s credit rating at ‘BBB-‘ later that month. The article was published on January 18, 2024, at 11:30 AM IST.

Published on By Banks Rush to Expanding Presence in Ayodhya, Expect Surge in Business Activity with Opening of Ram Temple Lenders like HDFC Bank, J&K Bank, and Karnataka Bank are eager to expand their presence in Ayodhya in anticipation of increased business activity coinciding with the opening of the Ram temple later this month. They are also competing to secure the deposit accounts of the Ram Mandir. According to a senior bank officer, many banks, including private ones, have approached the Ram Mandir Trust for their bank accounts in light of the expected surge in donations and payments for various temple-related events. Currently, the Ram Mandir Trust has accounts with three PSU banks – Bank of Baroda, State Bank of India, and Punjab National Bank, with total deposits worth about Rs 3,000 crore as of March 2023. The Trust has already spent over Rs 1,000 crore on temple construction. With around 250 bank branches in the district, Bank of Baroda leads with 34 branches, followed by State Bank of India with 26 branches. Despite the rise of digital banking, physical branches remain crucial for commercial banks, especially for deposit mobilization. HDFC Bank plans to open an additional branch within a month, and another by March-end, while Karnataka Bank recently inaugurated its 915th branch in the temple town. Private sector lender Axis Bank is set to increase its ATM presence in Ayodhya by deploying mobile ATMs at various locations to address the anticipated rise in demand. With the temple’s opening scheduled for January 22, Ayodhya has witnessed increased business activities, prompting banks like Jammu and Kashmir Bank to consider opening new branches in the town. Recognizing the upcoming business opportunities, banks are making strategic moves to capitalize on the potential business boom in Ayodhya. Published On Jan 19, 2024 at 08:00 AM IST Published on By RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has indicated that interest rates will remain high until the 4% inflation goal is met. He stated that it would be premature to discuss rate cuts until there is clear evidence that inflation will sustain at that level. The governor emphasized that the focus is on remaining “actively disinflationary” and that market expectations should not surpass central bank actions. While inflation is currently within the target range of 4-6%, the RBI is working to achieve the 4% target. Das mentioned that until sustainable inflation at the 4% level is reached, it would be too early for a rate cut due to various uncertainties. The RBI governor’s comments follow the upward revision of India’s economic growth projections for FY25 to 7% with inflation at 4.5%. These predictions suggest an improvement in economic conditions, allowing the governor to take a firm stance on interest rates. The RBI’s State of the Economy report highlighted a shift from consumption to investment, crowding in private investment, and an increase in potential output. However, the report stressed the need for inflation to align with the 4% target and for fiscal and external balances to continue consolidating. Food price volatility, previously viewed as a transient phenomenon, is another factor influencing the RBI’s cautious approach to easing policy. A report co-authored by RBI deputy governor Michael Patra indicated that food inflation has the potential to affect headline and non-food inflation due to its large share in the consumption basket. The RBI’s stance indicates that there are no immediate plans for interest rate cuts despite easing inflation. The governor’s remarks serve as a clear sign to the markets that rates will not be reduced until the 4% inflation target is met.

You are in,"OCBC unveils decarbonisation targets for six sectors to achieve Net Zero financed emissions by 2050  To accelerate the decarbonisation of the Oil and Gas sector, the Bank will not extend project financing to upstream Oil and Gas projects that obtained approval for development after 2021. SINGAPORE, 16 May 2023 – OCBC today unveiled science-based decarbonisation targets for six sectors – Power, Oil and Gas, Real Estate, Steel, Aviation and Shipping – and the key actions that the Bank will take to meet these targets as part of its commitment to achieve Net Zero in its financed emissions by 2050. The six sectors that OCBC has set targets for in its report Partnering Clients towards a Net Zero ASEAN and Greater China, represent the most greenhouse gas emission intensive sectors that the Bank finances. 42% of OCBC’s corporate and commercial banking loan portfolio falls within the scope of the targets as the Bank focuses on parts of the sector value chains responsible for the majority of the emissions. The availability of established and credible reference pathways for these sub-sectors is another key consideration. Notably, OCBC will not extend project financing to upstream Oil and Gas projects that obtained approval for development after 2021, as part of its decarbonisation efforts for this sector. This is on top of the target of 35% reduction in absolute emissions by 2030 for the Oil and Gas sector that the Bank has set. More information on the sectoral decarbonisation targets can be found in Annex A. Interim targets have been set for 2030 as a checkpoint to ensure the Bank is on track towards its 2050 goal. The targets will be reviewed periodically, at least once every five years, as climate science evolves and more data from clients become available. The targets are aligned to internationally-recognised, science-based pathways geared towards achieving a net zero level of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 to limit global warming to 1.5°C. To drive this transition journey, OCBC will continue to develop sustainable financing solutions for its corporate clients to finance their green and transition business activities. The Bank will deepen collaboration with stakeholders, from customers and regulators to green technology innovators, to co-create an ecosystem that will help catalyse the development and adoption of innovative technology solutions to accelerate decarbonisation. Said Ms Helen Wong, OCBC Bank Group CEO, “Our sectoral Net Zero targets are ambitious, quantitative and grounded in science. We will partner our corporate clients to meaningfully contribute to a Net-Zero ASEAN and Greater China by 2050 in an orderly and just transition. These targets are a culmination of months of hard work by many colleagues bank-wide and in our core markets of ASEAN and Greater China. “Beyond the numbers, this exemplifies key aspects of our vigorously partnership-based approach. I firmly believe that a more sustainable world can be created so long as we are united with our clients and communities in pursuing one.” The sectoral targets and pathways build on OCBC’s earlier efforts to achieve Net Zero in its goal to build a sustainable future. The Bank has been proactively engaging its clients to develop and invest in greener assets by offering bespoke sustainable financing solutions. The OCBC 1.5°C loan, launched in March 2023, is one such example. The loan incentivises corporates to set and work towards clear emissions reduction targets aligned with internationally recognised, science-based decarbonisation pathways for their sectors. When the targets are met or exceeded, corporates can get a reduced interest rate on their loans. By the end of March 2023, OCBC’s sustainable finance portfolio was $47 billion, placing the Bank well on track to achieving its target of $50 billion by 2025. On the consumer front, over $3.5 billion in OCBC Eco-Care loans – for homes, renovations and vehicles – have been extended since their introduction in March 2021, incentivising individuals to make more climate-friendly lifestyle choices.

Lender commits to ambitious 2050 zero-emissions goals for 6 industries,"SINGAPORE -- Major Singaporean lender United Overseas Bank will end new loans to oil and gas developments as part of long-term goals for net-zero emissions, the company said Monday. UOB already became carbon neutral last year for its internal operations. Now the group will set its sights on clients in six carbon-heavy sectors, aiming to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions among its borrowers by 2050.

Bank sets 2050 net-zero targets for polluting sectors,"Singapore’s United Overseas Bank (UOB) will provide no new project financing for upstream oil and gas projects approved for development after 2022, following in the footsteps of an increasing number of European lenders. The bank has announced ambitious commitments to reach net zero by 2050, underlining its goal to support a just transition that advances sustainable socioeconomic development in tandem with decarbonisation in Southeast Asia. UOB is understood to be the first major bank in Asia to stop supporting oil and gas projects, although funding for existing projects will continue. Its commitments cover six carbon-intensive sectors, which combined account for about 60% of its corporate lending portfolio. These six sectors are oil and gas, power, construction, steel, automotive and real estate. UOB said that, using internationally recognised climate science models, it based its sectoral targets on “regional pathways” that align with global net-zero goals. UOB said this approach to net zero reflects a strong belief in the need for a just transition in Southeast Asia while continuing to support economic growth and improve energy access across the region’s diverse economies. “In Southeast Asia, our net-zero ambitions must go hand in hand with an orderly and just transition to take into account socioeconomic challenges. Even as we cut our carbon footprint, we must ensure that people’s lives and livelihoods can continue to improve,” UOB chief executive Wee Ee Cheong said. “It is important to balance growth with responsibility on our net-zero journey. Our targets are ambitious, yet realistic, and they also meet the global goals of net zero for Asean.” The six sectors were selected based on three principles: the highest level of greenhouse gas emissions; the largest expected decline in greenhouse gas emissions in the coming years; and those industries in which UOB believes it has the greatest potential to effect change, Singapore daily the Straits Times reported. UOB’s commitments for the other five sectors include interim 2030 targets to reflect the necessary near-term progress on the path to net zero. For the power sector, its goal is to reduce emissions intensity (compared to the 2021 baseline) by 61% by the end of this decade and reduce emissions intensity by 98% by 2050; while for steel its goals are to reduce emissions intensity by 20% by 2030 and by 92% by 2050. In addition, UOB has committed to exiting financing for the thermal coal sector by 2039 — this is in addition to the bank’s existing prohibitions on new project financing of greenfield or expansion of coal-fired power plants and thermal coal mines. UOB added it is integrating its net-zero plans into its business strategies and will step up its efforts in working closely with clients and other stakeholders towards decarbonisation. The bank will conduct annual reporting to track progress against its net-zero commitments and, over time, it intends to expand the scope of its targets to include additional sectors as data and climate scenarios become available. Underlining its stated commitment to regional and global decarbonisation efforts, UOB is joining the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, which comprises 121 banks from 41 countries with US$70 trillion in global banking assets. In September, Singapore’s leading bank, DBS, unveiled a decarbonisation plan for nine industries including the oil and gas sector. Meanwhile, OCBC Bank, another major Singaporean lender, will publicise carbon reduction plans for separate industries by the first half of 2023, according to Nikkei Asia, a Japanese English-language news publication.

SOUTH-EAST Asia’s second-largest lender, OCBC, will aim to reduce by 2050 the absolute emissions for the oil and gas sector attributable to the bank by 95 per cent from its 2021 levels. It will also stop financing upstream oil and gas projects that were approved after 2021. In addition to the oil and gas sector, OCBC also announced decarbonisation targets for five other sectors – power, real estate, steel, aviation and shipping – as part of its wider net-zero commitments by 2050. These six sectors make up about 67 per cent of OCBC’s corporate and commercial banking loan portfolio. But the targets themselves account for 42 per cent of the portfolio, as the bank focuses on parts of the value chains that make up the bulk of emissions. Out of these six sectors, real estate is the largest contributor to the bank’s revenue. OCBC is the last of the three Singapore banks to announce its net-zero targets, as it joins a wave of global financial institutions facing pressure to cut financing of “dirty” projects or companies, and to mitigate climate-related risks within their portfolios. DBS was the first local bank to do so last September, followed by UOB about a month later. Mike Ng, head of the bank’s global wholesale banking sustainability office, said on Tuesday (May 16) that the magnitude of targets set for the oil and gas sector is “significant and ambitious”. The targets also include a 35 per cent reduction by 2030. Start and end each day with the latest news stories and analyses delivered straight to your inbox. “According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), to be compatible with a 1.5 degrees Celsius world, oil and gas that are in fields that have not obtained approval before 2021 should continue to stay in the ground and not be extracted. So what we are doing is that we are drawing a line in the sand,” he added. Tan Teck Long, head of global wholesale banking at OCBC, said that the bank’s exposure to upstream oil and gas projects has been reduced to an “immaterial amount”, given that it was avoiding such projects even before announcing its decarbonisation targets. Nevertheless, Ng acknowledged that the targets set for the sector will definitely have an impact on revenue, given that the bank does have some upstream financing projects. However, OCBC’s chief executive officer Helen Wong said that this does not stop the bank’s revenue as a whole from growing, because other parts of the portfolio will bring in business. She said: “Today, what we are talking about is focusing on really how to help our customer to (make the) transition. So there will definitely be some revenue forgone because you’re changing your portfolio. But in a way, we’re actually rebuilding our portfolio in a less carbon-emitting manner.” In contrast to the oil and gas sector, where decarbonisation targets are set based on absolute emissions, other sectors are guided by emission intensity targets. For such sectors, the bank will aim to lower emissions per unit of output or activity, though this may not necessarily lead to a lower absolute level of emissions. Unlike other sectors where an emission intensity reduction target has been set for 2050, OCBC aims to reach net zero by 2040 for the power sector. Ng said that this is because of the enabling nature of the power industry to decarbonise other sectors, including transportation, manufacturing and real estate. Justin Tan, partner at financial service consultancy Arthur D Little, said that this target is “a highly laudable and lofty ambition”, premised on the rationale that renewable energy technologies are already significantly more mature and deployable at scale, compared to other more nascent sectors for green technologies. OCBC said it is focusing on these six sectors based on each sector’s emissions intensity and whether it occupies a significant portion of the bank’s portfolio. The bank will also be making public whether it had achieved its financed emissions targets annually. These targets will also be reviewed at least once every five years as climate science evolves and more data from clients become more available. Tan said that the bank is looking to focus on the agricultural sector next and will soon begin collecting data. The agricultural sector is not included in the first phase of OCBC’s decarbonisation targets due to difficulties in data collection. When asked how OCBC will manage clients who are unable to meet their decarbonisation targets, Tan said that the bank works with its clients closely on their transition journey, and it will try to understand why some of them are unable to meet the bank’s expectations. “As long as they show good faith in bringing the decarbonisation target to meet it along the pathway, then we are fine. Now, if we find a customer, who doesn’t want to be part of the journey, who refuses to be in the executed transition, that’s a different thing altogether. And we might have to consider, as a last resort, after constant discussion with the customer, to phase out the relationship,” he added. OCBC had achieved S$47 billion in sustainable financing commitments by the first quarter of 2023; of this sum, S$32 billion, accounting for 11 per cent of the bank’s total loan book, has been drawn down. Market watchers have commended OCBC’s decarbonisation strategy. Tan from Arthur D Little said the bank has set a high bar, while Kevin Milla, carbon specialist at sustainability consultancy firm Paia Consulting, said that its targets are either meeting or exceeding those of the other two local banks. For one, the decision to end project financing for upstream oil and gas projects from 2021 — a target which DBS has not yet set — is endorsed by the IEA’s net-zero pathway. Milla noted that the financial sector may have some indirect responsibility in assuring current fossil fuel infrastructure assets are not stranded from divestment, and that emissions leakages from divestment are minimised. Hence, some fossil fuel infrastructure may have requirements in the interim. While all three banks include operational emissions of building assets under their real estate targets, Milla pointed out that only OCBC captures tenant electricity use that is typically not covered under Scope 2 reporting. “OCBC extending the target to tenant electricity use is a step in the right direction to include the value chain emissions of real estate. Many of the key sectors cut across each other such as power and steel with real estate, so it is a welcome development, albeit downstream with tenants rather than upstream with the power and steel,” he added. Milla also noted that OCBC’s target for the power sector may be more ambitious than other financial institutions. He pointed out that decarbonising this particular sector would create a domino effect in the economy as every industry’s power mix may also decarbonise, which in turn could lead to more green power generation. “OCBC’s senior management has recognised not only the complexities of making this successful transition, but also the potential impact on revenue and even client relationships – it is a strategic trade-off which the bank seems be very clear-eyed about,” said Tan from Arthur D Little.

      Commentary: Bad news for Singapore’s oil and gas industry as young people shun fossil fuels?
  ","

      Commentary
  
 Students have called out local universities’ engagement with the fossil fuel industry, which might be one more troubling development for the country's petrochemical industry, say energy researcher Melissa Low and environmental studies undergraduate Saw Sze Jie. Chemical refineries in Singapore. (Photo: AFP) SINGAPORE: Singapore is one of the world’s leading energy and chemical hubs, home to companies with major refining and petrochemical operations.   But young people find the fossil fuel industry unappealing, with many considering a career in clean energy a safer bet.  On Jan 17, Students For A Fossil Free Future (S4F) highlighted the links between Singapore universities and the fossil fuel industry in a 68-page report. The group called for an end to the fossil fuel industry’s influence on Singapore’s education system.  Although many oil and gas firms have announced plans to use the pandemic to rethink sustainability and have invested heavily in clean technologies, this generation perceives that fossil fuels are bad, informed by worldwide climate movements calling for the industry’s end.  To them, reduced consumption and clean energy should be favoured over fossil fuels if we are truly aiming for a net-zero future. Moreover, the pandemic has brought about renewed emphasis on health and well-being, which could result in a slower flow of new talent into the oil and gas sector. Are these troubling developments for Singapore’s petrochemical industry, long an engine for the country’s economic growth? With Singaporean universities offering more courses in environmental sciences, nature-based solutions, green finance and more, local youth are better-equipped than ever to step up and speak out on the climate crisis.  It’s then no wonder that students feel the need to call out universities’ engagement with the fossil fuel industry. These include research and scholarship funding, networking events, as well as concerts and conservation programmes sponsored by oil majors.  Should universities be funded by returns generated from industries that are driving the climate crisis? One pertinent concern is that when universities receive funding from the oil and gas industry, there may be forms of self-censorship where researchers and educators may be reluctant to flag the impact the industry has on the environment. Universities that work hand-in-hand with the industry may be offering a social licence for continued environmental degradation. S4F argues oil and gas industry players use university campus spaces to improve their public image and normalise their presence. These calls for universities to divest suggest young people see oil and gas as a poor career choice.  Although this shift in attitudes is not unique to Singapore, it could have economy-wide repercussions given the country’s dependence on the energy and chemicals sector.  Currently, Singapore is the world’s third largest exporter of petroleum and has two islands, Jurong Island and Bukom Island, dedicated to the petrochemical industry alone.  A steady pipeline of workers is required to provide energy and products essential for the functioning of society, and to ensure that operations are managed safely and in-line with industry standards and decarbonisation pathways.  The refined petroleum product and chemical product sectors employed 23,414 workers in 2020 and contributed 2.3 per cent of Singapore’s GDP in 2019 and 10.8 per cent of manufacturing. There aren’t other comparable examples given that Singapore is the only hub market which is a country. Other hubs, or large regional refining centres, are found in north-west Europe including Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Antwerp and the US Gulf Coast refineries on the coast of Texas and Louisiana, where the industries and workers have access to a hinterland and hence more job seekers and opportunities.  That said, Singapore is an open economy and the oil and gas industry may seek to make up for the talent shortfall with overseas applicants. However, balancing local jobs and migrant workers is something companies here, as well as the union representing them, the United Workers of Petroleum Industry, are mindful about.  Related operations such as storage, tanker and shipping could also be affected if the oil and gas industry is disrupted.   The reality is that youth see the urgency of decarbonisation in the energy sector and are taking matters into their own hands. According to surveys conducted by the National Youth Council, youth across all age bands are participating more in civic activity including environmental conservation efforts over recent years.  Some have founded groups such as the Student Energy Singapore Chapter in the National University of Singapore and the Clean Energy Club in Nanyang Technological University. Both organise events that engage industry players in conversations on accelerating the energy transition, showing that our youth have not been too quick to denounce the oil and gas industry. A student from S4F said the “substantial” investments in renewable and cleaner technologies are incomparable to the resources Big Oil has poured into fossil fuel operations. Youth are concerned about the lack of plans to invest in retraining and reskilling efforts to prepare workers for a green economy. They reject the industry's attempts to greenwash their “sustainability” plans.  For example, the expansion plans of oil and petrochemical operations even after Singapore announced its long-term low-emissions development strategy to halve its peak emissions from 65 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) in 2030 to 33 million tCO2e by 2050 drew ire among young people. They also remain unconvinced by labels such as “carbon neutral” or “green” when paired with hydrocarbons such as liquefied natural gas or even hydrogen, which currently still requires the burning of fossil fuels in its production.   Although oil and gas companies are indeed moving towards low-carbon technologies, perhaps they’re not doing it well enough or that youth are simply not open to such messages.  In a youth initiative, the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association found the oil and gas industry does not present a future that young people want to be a part of because of generational gaps in world views and how knowledge is produced and consumed.  Millennials and Gen-Zers have experienced massive leaps in technology in the recent decades compared to generations before, which may have resulted in a more optimistic view of the future and what can be achieved.  The solution, or compromise, is that the oil and gas industry needs to adapt to the younger generation’s need for self-realisation. The energy industry must also continue to highlight how they are meaningfully supporting society and industries towards the same better future young people want.  Transformations in the oil and gas sector must be clearly articulated. According to a Deloitte Insight published in 2020 on the future of work in oil, gas and chemicals, in order to grow, these companies must not only craft career pathways in new energy, it must also set cross-skilling programmes for futuristic roles and identify new intersectional leadership opportunities.  Engagement is key, but there is a caveat. Youth might be more open to change their mind if they can engage in a discussion with someone closer to their own age with whom they can relate. The oil and gas industry can do this by increasing direct projects and workplace pairing with younger workers such as through reverse mentoring programmes, where more experienced senior workers can count on a fresh set of eyes for difficult problems. Ultimately, the right talent is necessary for decarbonising the oil and gas industry, which is key to the energy transition. Bridges must be built instead of walls. The oil and gas industry must accelerate decarbonisation and make clear that people, not profits, are at their core.  Universities must also continue to be part of this conversation. We must have open, frank discussions about Singapore’s talent landscape in a post-pandemic and increasingly carbon-constrained world. Universities can mediate the flow of ideas between the youth and the oil and gas industry so they can better understand each other.  Greater engagement, not less, is the answer if we wish to reduce the gap between what oil and gas companies think young people want and what young people actually want: Job stability, work-life balance, happiness and self-realisation.

      IN FOCUS: Singapore’s energy and chemicals sector set for change as net-zero transition, competition fuel uncertainties
  ","

      Singapore
  
 The energy and chemicals sector is a key part of the Singapore economy but with one of the biggest players mulling a review of its assets here, what lies ahead for the sector? Singapore's Pulau Bukom is home to Shell’s only energy and chemicals park in Asia. (Photo: Shell) SINGAPORE: On July 26, 1961, a sprawling industrial complex marked by a maze of steel pipes and towering chimneys was declared open on Pulau Bukom, an island located 5km south of Singapore. Completed in slightly over a year, the S$30-million oil refinery by European energy firm Shell was Singapore’s first such facility. It was also a much-needed investment for the small island nation that achieved self-governance just two years before and was pursuing rapid industrialisation to create jobs. “It is a significant landmark in our industrialisation programme,” said then-Finance Minister Goh Keng Swee at the opening attended by officials and company representatives. More oil and gas companies followed in the footsteps of Shell, setting up refineries on neighbouring small islands that later merged and became Jurong Island, a dedicated energy and chemicals park. Operating round the clock, these plants, with their flames at times casting an orange glow in the night sky, turned crude oil into gasoline, diesel and other products which were sold to different parts of the world. Together, they fired up a new sector that grew into a cornerstone of the Singapore economy, as well as cemented the country’s position as one of the world’s top energy and chemicals hubs. Back in Pulau Bukom, the Shell refinery was expanded in size over the decades, processing as much as 500,000 barrels per day of oil at its peak. The plant also levelled up to manufacture petrochemicals such as ethylene, making it Shell’s only wholly owned refining and petrochemicals facility in Asia. But the future of this historical facility now appears to be up in the air, as Shell announced in June a strategic review of its assets on Pulau Bukom and a petrochemical facility on Jurong Island. This comes on the heels of the company’s decision earlier this year to drop two projects on biofuels and base oil production in Singapore, as well as an announcement in 2020 to halve processing capacity and cut jobs at the Pulau Bukom refinery. Replying to queries from CNA, the energy giant reiterated an earlier statement that the latest review is done in response to the ongoing “high grading journey” of its chemicals and products portfolio, current challenging market conditions and enhanced capital discipline. “Our strategic review is ongoing and we are exploring several options including divestment,” it said. Given its history and huge presence in Singapore, Shell’s latest move has “great significance” for the local energy and chemical sector, said Mr Leow Foon Lee, visiting senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Energy Studies Institute. Other players could embark on similar reviews of their local operations, as they contemplate how to maintain profitability in an era of extreme commodity price volatility, looming uncertainties in the global economy, oversupply in the market and the transition to a low-carbon world, industry experts told CNA. In particular, energy transition forms the biggest pressure on the industry, which is traditionally carbon-intensive, to find ways to reduce their own carbon footprint while remaining economically viable. Official figures showed the energy and chemicals sector contributed around three per cent of Singapore’s gross domestic product (GDP) and one-fifth of the country’s total manufacturing output in 2020. Overall, the sector employs more than 27,000 people. On Jurong Island, more than 100 energy, petrochemical and specialty chemicals firms are up and running, operating an integrated mix of refining and petrochemicals production. Amid the headwinds, what lies ahead for Singapore’s energy and chemicals sector? Experts said Shell’s decision reflects the confluence of headwinds confronting the oil industry. One major challenge is the global push for more to be done to fight climate change, which has seen oil and gas companies moving beyond their core business to attempt the risky transition to low-carbon technologies. Many, including Shell, have laid out net-zero ambitions. The transition will require significant investments. Yet, the oil refining business is seeing thinning margins due to volatile commodity prices, rising production costs and growing surplus in the market largely because of the rise of new mega refineries in China. At the same time, the call for energy efficiency and greener products, alongside uncertainties in the global economy, is threatening to dampen global demand for oil. Lower demand for traditional gasoline and diesel fuels as people opt for electric vehicles, for example, will hurt the profits of oil refineries, said Mr Leow. Mr Sushant Gupta, Asia-Pacific research director for refining and oils market at energy research and consultancy Wood Mackenzie, foresees global oil demand peaking in 2032, although the fall in demand for diesel and gasoline will be helped by growing demand for petrochemical products. Petrochemicals – such as ethylene, propylene and benzene derived from petroleum or natural gas by refining – are used to create materials like plastics, nylons, polyesters which in turn form the building blocks of everyday items in people’s lives. The International Energy Agency estimates that petrochemicals are set to account for more than a third of the growth in world oil demand to 2030, and nearly half the growth to 2050. “At a time when refineries are already worrying about margins, they find themselves having to think about how to make their site carbon competitive … and they also have to invest to shift more towards petrochemical production because that’s what the market needs,” said Mr Gupta.  “Justifying some of these investments under a low-margin environment, that could continue for the future, could become tough for many players.” He added: “This would entail a strategic review for many sites and it is something which Shell and all the oil majors are doing to review the health of their business and assets.” For Singapore, the rise of export-oriented refineries in China, Malaysia and Brunei is also a cause for concern. “Despite (being) an oil trading and storage bub, Singapore faces inherent disadvantages to compete with Malaysia in terms of operating and labour costs and intense competition from new refining and petrochemical parks in Malaysia and Brunei,” said Mr San Naing, senior oil and gas analyst at research firm BMI. For Shell, the six-decade-old refinery on Pulau Bukom is losing competitiveness. High operating costs aside due to local factors such as manpower, Mr Gupta pointed to the lack of feedstock advantage which makes the site no longer within the “top quartile of Shell’s portfolio”. Feedstock is the raw material that goes into refining and chemical plants, such as crude oil which is then refined into diesel, kerosene or naphtha that are in turn used as feedstocks to manufacture a wide variety of petrochemicals. Singapore has no hydrocarbon resources, and imports crude oil for its refining and petrochemical industries. During a question-and-answer segment at the company’s capital markets day in June, Shell’s chief executive Wael Sawan said: “The challenge with Singapore for us is that, you don’t have advantaged feedstock coming in. You don’t have advantaged energy costs, utility costs. “Our current configuration of our plant is towards a more simple product, so it is just fundamentally disadvantaged. Therefore, we are just looking at can it be more valuable for us or for others in a different way.” On top of all that, Singapore’s carbon tax serves as a “pressure point” for refiners, experts said. Currently, Singapore's carbon tax rate – applied to facilities that directly emit at least 25,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions per year – is set at S$5 per tonne until 2023. This is set to go up to S$25 in 2024 and 2025 and S$45 in 2026 and 2027, before reaching S$50 to S$80 per tonne by 2030. Based on the emission profile of Pulau Bukom, that could “potentially mean a carbon price impact on the margin of up to S$2 per barrel”, according to Mr Gupta.  With the depressed forecast for demand and refinery margins, the carbon tax is set to have a “significant dent” on the overall competitiveness of refineries in Singapore, he added. Meanwhile, Singapore is the “only country” in Asia that has imposed a carbon tax on refineries, said Mr Gupta. Others such as China and South Korea have in place carbon emissions trading systems. “We don't see the others like China, India, South Korea and the Middle East putting a strict carbon tax on refineries by 2030 … So there is an uneven playing field between Singapore and other markets.” Media reports have said Shell is tapping investment bank Goldman Sachs to explore deals for its assets. Despite being named in these reports, Asia’s largest refiner, Sinopec, has ruled itself out and said last month it is not interested in acquiring Shell’s refinery or petrochemical plant in Singapore. BMI’s Mr Naing noted that it is “very likely” other players could mirror Shell and kickstart similar reviews of their operations in Singapore. “Obviously, there are no longer incentives to expand refining and petrochemical production capacities in Singapore due mainly to the rise of new plants in China, Malaysia and Brunei,” he added. But how that might pan out and whether the sector could see a decline in contributions to GDP growth remains too early to tell, experts said. One reason is that assets could be “sold at discounted price” to new owners who will continue to operate these plants, said Mr Naing. For the Bukom site, Singapore’s strategic location along key trading routes and proximity to Southeast Asia, a growing demand market, will remain an attractive point for any buyer. “We still see Southeast Asia as a strong market for refined oil and chemical products, and Singapore has extreme advantage there,” Mr Gupta said. Those interested in Shell’s assets on Pulau Bukom could include Middle Eastern refiners that are looking to expand into Southeast Asia. Global trading companies would also be keen to leverage Singapore’s hub status in not just oil and gas, but also financial and trading activities. In addition, Singapore has existing strengths such as being an established logistics hub, experts said. In response to CNA’s queries, Shell reiterated an earlier statement that its review is limited to its assets on Pulau Bukom and Jurong Island. “Singapore’s position as a trading and marketing hub to serve our customers in the region remains important,” it said. Another major player ExxonMobil said Singapore is a “strategic location” for the firm. Here, it has an integrated refining-petrochemical complex that serves markets in the region and around the world. With a capacity of about 592,000 barrels per day, it is one of the American oil and gas giant’s largest in the world.  Apart from that, construction is progressing on its multi-billion-dollar upgrading project for higher-value lubricant base stocks and cleaner fuels in Singapore. This remains on track to start in 2025, said Ms Geraldine Chin, chairman and managing director of ExxonMobil Asia Pacific. Experts said that all players in the sector will have to continue to put more decarbonisation options on the table and implement them. These include raising the output of sustainable products from their plants, such as bio-based fuels and chemicals. Refiners will also need to look at using more renewable feedstock while putting in place more sustainable production processes to reduce carbon emissions and pollution.  “Singapore doesn’t have a huge advantage on the feedstock side so to overcome that disadvantage, it will have to think about other things,” said Mr Gupta. “The sector, and the overall manufacturing sector, in Singapore will have to continue to get more competitive in this carbon-constrained world.” Efforts by the Singapore authorities to ensure the country stays on top of its game are under way. Officials have said that while the low-carbon transition has implications for the local economy – such as the energy and chemicals sector at risk of being downsized or even displaced if the transition is done “too hastily” – there are benefits and opportunities to be seized. For example, the chemicals industry provides silver paste, high-performance plastic films and membranes that are needed to make photovoltaic cells and batteries for electric vehicles, said then-Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing in a written parliamentary reply dated April 2021. Meanwhile, Jurong Island is going to be transformed into a “sustainable energy and chemicals park”. The aim is to quadruple its output of sustainable products from 2019 levels and achieve more than six million tonnes of carbon abatement per annum from low-carbon solutions by 2050. This shift in focus for Jurong Island will help Singapore to become a more attractive location for green investments, said Singapore Economic Development Board’s (EDB) executive vice-president Damian Chan. The agency, which leads the planning and execution of Singapore’s economic strategies, is also working with companies to improve the energy efficiency of existing plants, while ensuring that new plants are the “best-in-class”. At the same time, EDB is in “active conversations” with companies on energy transition projects and opportunities, such as the development of low-carbon technologies, carbon capture, utilisation and storage, as well as low-carbon hydrogen, Mr Chan said. “We have continued to see a healthy flow of investments from energy and chemicals companies who are keen to expand their global presence, grow new capabilities to capture green growth opportunities in the region, and transform their business to be environmentally sustainable,” he told CNA. “A transformed and more sustainable energy and chemicals sector will continue to remain an attractive growth sector for Singapore,” said Mr Chan. Recent investments into the country include Finnish refiner Neste’s expansion of its biorefinery in Tuas to produce sustainable aviation fuel and the set-up of a bio-factory by French chemicals company Arkema to make high-performance polymers from sustainable materials on Jurong Island. ExxonMobil is also mulling projects that meet the demand for sustainable solutions and reduce its own carbon emissions. “We have developed and will update our emission-reduction roadmaps for our operated assets around the world, including our Singapore complex,” said Ms Chin. The company is also advancing solutions, such as carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and lower-emission fuels such as sustainable aviation fuels and renewable diesel. Specifically on carbon capture and storage, it has announced progress on multiple opportunities around the world so far. “We are studying the potential for a regional (carbon capture and storage) hub to capture, transport and store carbon dioxide from heavy industrial activity across Southeast Asia, including our operations in Singapore,” Ms Chin said. Still, the green transition of an inherently carbon-intensive sector will be “an uphill task”, said Mr Naing. “Despite the government’s efforts to keep the industry competitive and sustainable, companies are the ones bearing the rising costs of doing business and feel the competitive pressures from other countries,” he added. “It is easier said than done.” Echoing a similar view, NUS’ Mr Leow cited the excitement surrounding green hydrogen as an example. Some experts have said that Singapore can leverage its geographical position and existing expertise in the fossil fuel industry to become a storage, trading and transportation hub for low-carbon hydrogen. While there is potential, observers like Mr Leow reckoned that there is some way to go before green hydrogen can become economically viable. Unlike the most common form of hydrogen production, which is a carbon-intensive process called steam methane reformation and yields “grey” hydrogen, the green version relies on renewable energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen via electrolysis. Producing green hydrogen remains a costly venture due to the availability of renewable electricity, expenditure on electrolysers and infrastructure such as pipelines and storage sites. In 2020, green hydrogen constituted just 0.1 per cent of global hydrogen production, according to a report by Wood Mackenzie, noting that the “economics are a challenge”. In Singapore, the challenge lies in the country’s energy mix which is predominantly fossil fuels. While some tweaks to existing gas pipelines may be done, new storage and distribution infrastructure will likely be needed as hydrogen has different properties from natural gas, experts said. “It is highly flammable so it’s not easy to keep and handle, especially for long storage and transportation. We will have to explore different ways that can receive this on a commercial scale,” said Mr Leow. “Hydrogen can help enhance Singapore’s position as an energy hub, but there’s a long journey to go.” Experts also noted that the sector’s transformation would inevitably lead to changes in the job market. Some traditional manufacturing roles could be cut with the closure or downsizing of plants, although this would be buffered by the creation of new roles in environmental compliance and sustainability. “Let me add a word of caution that this is going to take time and it will create a lot of displacements, so it is very important to have a comprehensive approach in this whole transition, and not just piecemeal efforts,” said Mr Leow, while stressing an “immediate need” for workforce upskilling and retraining. On that, EDB’s Mr Chan said existing skillsets in the industry can be applicable to the green transition. For example, process engineers and technicians are able to apply their skills to decarbonise manufacturing plants and in the manufacturing of sustainable products. Nonetheless, initiatives under the industry’s transformation map are helping workers to pick up new skills like sustainable manufacturing and carbon footprint management, he added. “As the sector upgrades and transforms, we will continue to work closely with the industry to … equip our workers with the relevant skills to address evolving needs,” Mr Chan told CNA. While the economic impact may be less certain, one thing is for sure – the energy and chemicals sector’s move to adapt to a low-carbon future can yield environmental benefits. Around one-third of Singapore’s total carbon emissions are direct emissions from the sector, according to a parliamentary reply issued last April. Pivoting towards more sustainable practices will help to reduce the sector’s carbon footprint and in turn, Singapore’s. On Oct 25 last year, the country announced that it would raise its national climate target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. “You get better air quality for one,” said Mr Leow. “Hopefully, trying out different technologies can also help to solve the big challenge of being more energy efficient, and these low-carbon technologies can be used in other industries.” Editor’s note: This article has been updated to correct information about Singapore’s net-zero goals.

"NEW YORK – For the second year in a row, global banks made more money underwriting bonds and providing loans for green projects than they earned from financing oil, gas and coal activities. ","The world’s biggest lenders generated a total of about US$3 billion (S$4 billion) in fees in 2023 from lining up debt for deals marketed as environmentally friendly, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. By comparison, the sector brought in less than US$2.7 billion in aggregate earnings from fossil fuel transactions. European banks led the transition, with BNP Paribas topping Bloomberg’s green debt league table. Meanwhile, Wall Street dominated fossil finance, with Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase generating the biggest earnings from oil and gas deals. BNP, the European Union’s largest bank, got close to US$130 million in 2023 from its green finance business. Credit Agricole was next with US$96 million and then HSBC Holdings with US$94 million. On the other side of the energy divide, Wells Fargo earned fees of US$107 million from arranging bonds and loans for the fossil fuel sector, followed closely by JPMorgan and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), both with US$106 million. To be sure, MUFG was also the top arranger of global green loans in 2023. The development coincides with stricter regulations in Europe, where both the European Central Bank and the region’s top banking authority have made clear they want the finance industry to speed up its green transition. Lenders in Europe now face the threat of fines and higher capital requirements if they mismanage climate exposures. In response, many banks are imposing explicit restrictions on fossil finance.
 In the United States, meanwhile, the regulatory outlook remains uncertain and fragmented as many Republican states place hurdles in the way of the green transition. Banks suspected of withholding financing from the oil and gas sector increasingly face retaliation, with Texas among states threatening to cut off Wall Street firms that embrace net-zero emission goals. Against that backdrop, the global finance industry has fallen well short of where it needs to be if the goals of the Paris climate agreement are to be met. According to an analysis by BloombergNEF (BNEF), four times as much capital needs to be allocated to green projects as to fossil fuels by 2030 to align with net-zero emission targets. Yet at the end of 2022, that ratio was just 0.7 to 1, largely unchanged from the previous year, BNEF’s latest figures show. Bank financing is not “anywhere close” to the transition levels needed, said Ms Trina White, a sustainable finance analyst at BNEF, when the December report was published. The perceived foot-dragging by global banks has environmentalists sounding the alarm.
 “Banks still aren’t keeping pace with the rate of transition that is required to avoid catastrophic climate change,” said Mr Jason Schwartz, senior communications strategist at Sunrise Project, a non-profit that is focused on the financial sector’s contribution to global warming. The shifting trends of 2023 are “more indicative of broader macroeconomic trends than any proactive efforts in the banking sector to reduce financing for carbon-intensive energy”, said Ms Adele Shraiman, senior campaign strategist at the Sierra Club, a grassroots environmental organisation in the United States. “The reality is that banks aren’t transitioning their energy financing quickly enough to meet their own climate goals.”  Last year was the hottest on record, according to the Global Carbon Project. The group, which represents an international collaboration of scientists, estimates that carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels rose 1.1 per cent to a new high in 2023, putting the planet on track to exceed its carbon budget for 1.5 deg C of warming by the end of the decade. Overall, banks extended US$583 billion in green bonds and loans in 2023, compared with US$527 billion of fossil fuel debt. In 2022, banks channelled US$594 billion into environmental projects, and US$558 billion into oil, gas and coal, the Bloomberg data showed. For several years now, the world’s biggest banks have published reports showing the vast sums of money they say they are allocating towards a greener, fairer planet. But some of those assertions are now being questioned amid an absence of regulatory guideposts to help stakeholders make sense of such claims. BLOOMBERG",straitstimes,Oil and Gas,Singapore
"SINGAPORE – Oil refiners are finding it harder to secure funding for projects as more banks shy away from fossil fuel financing, with plant owners now pressed to show that their businesses have cleaner-energy goals, executives said.","While the business is still profitable, getting financing is more challenging, according to Mr Alwyn Bowden, chief executive officer of Malaysia’s Pengerang Energy Complex.  From the point of view of many lenders, “if you have the word ‘refinery’ anywhere in your title, you’re not going to get finance”, Mr Bowden told the Asian Downstream Summit. The summit was held at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre on Wednesday and Thursday.  With the threat from climate change growing and the world trying to move towards net-zero emissions goals, Mr Bowden’s comments highlight a growing struggle for the industry.  Despite worldwide crude demand hitting an all-time high in 2023, lenders have become more wary of offering funding.  That has left the global refining system stretched, raising the risk of bottlenecks and volatile prices. The apparent mismatch between sustained hydrocarbon demand and a reluctance to invest in capacity or keep plants open has spurred global tensions in recent years.  When fuel costs spiked in 2022, Saudi Arabia’s top oil official laid the blame on a refining crunch and not on any shortage of crude. Now, plant owners will need to show that their business is in the process of transitioning to net-zero carbon dioxide emissions, Mr Bowden added on Wednesday.  For Pengerang Energy’s upcoming refinery, that push includes plans to use the plant’s waste products as fuel, as well as electrifying some operations, he said. Indonesia’s state-owned Pertamina has been able to attain financing, according to Ms Maria Katryn, senior financing manager at Kilang Pertamina. The company has environmental projects but has yet to fully curb emissions, she said.  Banks have placed more restrictions on financing oil and gas, with the expectation that the world will soon need less of them, said Mr Roger Charles, executive director of sustainability at DBS Bank.  A realistic narrative for energy-transition plans is key to accessing financing, he added.  Even then, pitching sustainable businesses comes with its pitfalls. “There are a lot of examples of greenwashing, where people – due to various pressures – get forced to commit to something which they cannot,” said Mr Mayank Vishnoi, chief financial officer of ChemOne Group.

"SINGAPORE (THE BUSINESS TIMES) - DBS on Thursday (April 30) guided that its oil-and-gas (O&G) lending portfolio at $23 billion makes up its single-largest loan exposure to impacted industries made vulnerable by the Covid-19 pandemic, and that it expects further allowances set aside specifically for O&G support services.","This comes as the bank reported a 29 per cent fall in Q1 net profit that brought its earnings to its lowest level since 2017. Singapore's largest bank opened the results season for the local trio with a large bump in allowances set aside to prepare for hits from the Covid-19 global pandemic.  As at 9.51am, shares of DBS were trading at $19.89, up 69 cents or 3.6 per cent. ""Credit cost will depend upon duration of the slowdown and how collateral values evolve,"" said Jefferies analyst Krishna Guha in a note on Thursday, while keeping a ""buy"" rating on the stock. ""Capital buffer, earlier digitalisation efforts and ample system liquidity put the bank in good stead to face the crisis."" The virus outbreak, which began in late December last year, has roiled global economies and added to the severe stress in the oil industry. The bank has identified eight industries more directly impacted by slowdown in its Q1 update. They are: O&G, aviation, hotels, gaming/cruise ships, tourism, retail, food and beverage, as well as shipping. Of its loan exposure to the ""impacted industries"", O&G makes up the single-largest sector with lending totalling $23 billion.  As an indication, the specific provisions of $383 million taken by DBS reflect one loan to an oil trader that was recognised as a non-performing asset in the quarter. It did not identify the oil trader.  Of the total $5 billion loans to oil traders, 50 per cent are backed by bank letters of credit. It also lends to global traders or state-owned companies. In its lending to support services, three-quarters of its lending exposure - that is, $3 billion out of $4 billion - have been recognised as non-performing assets. The bank expects to take further specific provisions on its exposure to support services, it said. As it is, the bank said it has taken a conservative stance in Q3 2017 to recognise soured exposure to support services, and has marked down collateral. It has a $7 billion loan exposure to oil producers, mainly to oil majors and state-owned companies, the bank said.  The bank showed that of its loans of $221 billion to large corporates - that is, excluding small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) - lending to those in ""impacted industries"" stood at $46 billion, or 20 per cent of that loan book. Total specific allowances translate to 35 basis points (bps) of loans. The bank guided that credit costs are to rise to between $3 billion and $5 billion - reflecting 80-130 bps of loans - cumulatively over two years.  This could mean an average of 67 bps of credit costs each year unless all are frontloaded, said CGS-CIMB analyst Andrea Choong in a flash note. She kept her ""hold"" rating on the counter. Total provisions set aside stood at $1.086 billion, comprising a $703 million cushion under general allowances, and the remainder for specific accounts that have gone sour. Of that $46 billion loan exposure to ""impacted industries"", loans to Singapore Inc companies by DBS made up $5 billion. The bank has an SME loanbook of $39 billion, 10 per cent of which is exposed to highly impacted industries such as hotels, food and beverage, and retailers.  Almost 90 per cent of SME exposure is in Singapore and Hong Kong, with that predominantly secured against property. Lending criteria to SMEs have also been tightened over the past two years, the bank guided. Its non-performing loan ratio ticked higher to 1.6 per cent, from 1.5 per cent.  DBS maintained its quarterly dividend payout at 33 cents, but flagged that it would ""adjust dividend policy as appropriate"" according to its ongoing assessment of the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on performance, credit costs and capital ratios. Its net profit for the first quarter for the three months ended March 31, 2020 dropped to $1.165 billion compared with $1.651 billion from the same period a year ago. This is in line with an average estimate of $1.13 billion from four analysts polled by Refinitiv.  The bank guided that its full-year profit before allowances to be around 2019 levels after factoring in declines for the rest of year. DBS's stress-test scenario offers a look at how lenders now see the crisis unfolding. The bank estimated as a base scenario that lockdowns in major economies continue until mid-2020, gradual recovery is seen in the second-half of the year and continues through to muted growth in 2021, while financial markets correct by an overall 20 per cent this year. The bank set its stress scenario by assuming that lockdowns in major economies continue through to end of the third quarter, with economic activity in 2021 ""still materially below"" 2019 levels, and financial markets to correct by 50 per cent in 2020. Under these scenarios, resulting impact on credit costs was comparable to the 2002-03 period and during the global financial crisis in 2008-2009. A Citi report had said that past recession peaks in credit-cost terms stood at up to 200 bps in the Asian financial crisis, and 100 bps in the global financial crisis. The bank has also provided loan moratoriums for more than 1,800 corporate facilities representing over $3.4 billion in total loans outstanding. It has also availed $3.2 billion in loan facilities to Singapore SMEs under the government relief programme. In the housing segment, DBS said its mortgage book stood at $75 billion in total, with minimal losses expected, as in past crises. Close to 8,000 mortgage principal and interest payment applications have been deferred, representing $4.7 billion in loans outstanding.  Net interest margin (NIM) stood at 1.86 per cent for the first quarter, unchanged from a year ago, and down from 1.88 per cent a quarter ago. The bank flagged the lag effect, saying that the NIM in Q1 does not reflect impact of recent interest rate cut. This will only be seen from Q2. Net interest income was up 7 per cent to $2.48 billion.  Fee income rose 14 per cent from a year ago to $832 million, while gains in investment securities boosted its income from other non-interest activities by 39 per cent to $712 million.",straitstimes,Oil and Gas,Singapore
