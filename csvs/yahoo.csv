"Singapore Construction Industry Databook - Compound Annual Growth of 2.7% is Forecast During 2023-2027, with Construction Output to Reach SGD 39.41 Billion by 2027","Dublin, Jan. 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Singapore Construction Industry Databook Series - Market Size & Forecast by Value and Volume (area and units), Q2 2023 Update"" report has been added to  ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The construction industry in Singapore was expected to grow by 2.3% to reach SGD 36.28 billion in 2023. Despite near-term challenges in certain construction sectors, medium to long term growth story in Singapore remains intact. The growth momentum is expected to continue over the forecast period, recording a CAGR of 2.7% during 2023-2027, with construction output forecast to reach SGD 39.41 billion by 2027.The pent-up demand is aiding the surge in construction activities, with the bulk of the work happening in residential and infrastructure construction space in Singapore. This trend is expected to further continue beyond 2023, leading into H1 2024.While the domestic construction sector has the potential to continue its upward growth trajectory from the short to medium-term perspective, it will remain vulnerable to global headwinds including rising interest rates and high inflation. For sustainable growth, industry players should work in collaboration across the supply chain, which will remain critical in driving an advanced and integrated sector.Demand for construction works is projected to remain stable throughout H1 2024Driven by the public sector, the construction demand has been projected to remain stable throughout the year. With the rescheduling of significant projects from 2022 to 2023 and the ongoing redevelopment of aging commercial properties aimed at enhancing asset values, the demand for commercial buildings is expected to surge. With projects like Build-To-Order (BTO) flats, MRT lines, and water treatment plants in the pipeline, the publisher is maintaining a stable growth outlook for the construction market in Singapore. Private sector construction demand is also projected to remain comparable and in line with the 2022 value. Private and public sector spending is expected to remain stable in H1 2024, despite the challenges faced by the construction market, including rising material costs.Construction material prices are projected to remain high in Q1 2024 in SingaporeAlthough the construction industry is projected to maintain a steady growth rate, the market will be faced with higher construction material prices in Singapore. Following an increase in prices in H1 2022, prices of construction materials like cement have remained elevated due to high production costs and rising demand. The reopening of the Chinese economy has also led to volatile copper prices in H1 2023.The decline in steel prices in H1 2023, on the other hand, has offered some respite to developers and the broader construction market in Singapore. However, steel prices are also projected to pick up pace in Q1 2024 on the back of robust demand, including in China. The commencement of construction activities on a number of civil engineering projects will also drive the steel prices upward in Singapore from the short to medium-term perspective.Data center construction activities to support the growth of the commercial construction market in SingaporeInvestment in data center space is poised to grow again in the Singaporean market, as the state city seeks to end a years-long moratorium on new developments. Since 2019, Singapore has imposed a moratorium on new data center developments, although previously approved facilities were permitted to proceed. In a partial easing of this ban in July 2022, the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) and the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) introduced a pilot scheme. Under this initiative, companies were given the opportunity to bid for permission to establish new data center facilities. Singtel, in August 2023, started the construction activities of its 58MW data center in Singapore. The data center, which is poised to go live in 2025, will provide growth support to the construction market in the state city over the next few quarters. Going forward, more such construction projects are projected to be announced in Singapore, thereby supporting the growth of the broader market from the short to medium-term perspective.This market intelligence report provides a detailed view of market opportunities in the building and infrastructure construction industry at country level.
